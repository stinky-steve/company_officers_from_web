The works themselves do not have to be stories specifically about women, and the target audience can be varied.\n It is also a variety of topics bundled together to create the work of women in film. This can include women filling behind-the-scenes roles such as director, cinematographer, writer, and producer while also addressing the stories of women and character development through screenplays (on the other hand, films made by men about women are instead called  Woman's film ).\n Renowned female directors include  Alice Guy-Blaché , film pioneer and one of the first film directors,  Agnès Varda , the first French New Wave director,  Margot Benacerraf   1959 , the first woman to win the  Cannes International Critics Prize  and be nominated for the Palme D'Or, Yulia Solntseva , the first woman to win the  Best Director Award  at Cannes Film Festival ( 1961 ),  Lina Wertmüller , the first woman nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Director  ( 1977 ),  Barbra Streisand , the first woman to win the  Golden Globe Award for Best Director  ( 1983 ),  Jane Campion , the first woman to win the  Palme D'Or  at Cannes Film Festival ( 1993 ), and  Kathryn Bigelow , the first woman to win the Academy Award for Best Director ( 2009 ), [ 1 ]  along with many other female directors from around the world such as  Dorothy Arzner ,  Ida Lupino ,  Lois Weber ,  Leni Riefenstahl ,  Mary Harron ,  Sofia Coppola ,  Kira Muratova ,  Claire Denis ,  Chantal Akerman ,  Catherine Breillat ,  Lucrecia Martel ,  Lynne Ramsay ,  Céline Sciamma ,  Claudia Weill , and  Julie Dash . Many successful cinematographers are also women, including  Margarita Pilikhina ,  Maryse Alberti ,  Reed Morano ,  Rachel Morrison ,  Halyna Hutchins , and Zoe White.\n Women's cinema recognizes women's contributions all over the world, not only to narrative films but to  documentaries  as well. Recognizing the work of women occurs through various festivals and awards, such as the  Cannes Film Festival , for example. [ 2 ] \n \"Women's cinema is a complex, critical, theoretical, and institutional construction,\"  Alison Butler explains. The concept has had its fair share of criticisms, causing some female filmmakers to distance themselves from it in fear of being associated with marginalization and ideological controversy. [ 2 ] \n \n \n Famous women in film history [ edit ] \n Silent films [ edit ] \n Alice Guy-Blaché  was a film pioneer and the first female director. [ 3 ]  Working for the  Gaumont Film Company  in France at the time that the cinema was being invented, she created  La Fée aux Choux  (1896). The dates of many early films are speculative, but  La Fée aux Choux  may well be the first narrative film ever released. [ 4 ]  She served as Gaumont's head of production from 1896 to 1906 and ultimately produced hundreds of  silent films  in France and the United States. [ 5 ] \n In Sweden,  Anna Hofman-Uddgren  was that country's first female film maker—producing the silent film  Stockholmsfrestelser  in 1911. She also acted in the film. [ 6 ]   However,  Ebba Lindkvist  directed the  short drama ,  Värmländingarna , which premièred in Sweden on 27 October 1910, thus technically making her the first woman film maker, [ 7 ]  and chronologically, the second ever female feature film director in the world, after Alice Guy-Blaché.\n Luise Fleck  was an Austrian film director, and has been considered the second ever female feature film director in the world, after Alice Guy-Blaché. In 1911 Luise Fleck directed  Die Glückspuppe .\n Elvira Notari  is the first Italian woman director to make a film. Notari's first films are  Maria Rosa di Santa Flavia ,  Carmela la pazza ,  Bufera d'anime , all made in 1911.\n Helen Gardner , a  Vitagraph Studios  player who had won acclaim for her portrayal of Becky Sharp in the 1910 version of  Vanity Fair , was the first film actor, male or female, to form her own production company, The Helen Gardner Picture Players. [ 8 ]  Gardner's first production was  Cleopatra  (1912), one of the first American full-length films.\n In 1913 Russian filmmaker  Olga Preobrazhenskaya  began directing films in the \"Timan and Reingardt\" studio. She is the first Russian woman director. Her first work as a director was the 1916 film  Miss Peasant  based on the work of the same name by  Aleksandr Pushkin .\n American-born director,  Lois Weber  was coached and inspired by Guy-Blaché and found success in creating silent films. [ 9 ]  Weber is well known for her films  Hypocrites  (1915),  The Blot  (1921), and  Suspense  (1913). Weber's films often focus on difficult social issues. For instance, her film  Where Are My Children?  (1916)  addresses the controversial issues of  birth control  and  abortion . And she questioned the validity of  capital punishment  in  The People vs. John Doe  (1916). [ 10 ] [ 11 ] \n Mabel Normand  was another significant early female filmmaker. She started as an actress and became a producer-writer-director in the 1910s, working on the first shorts  Charlie Chaplin  did as  The Tramp  at  Mack Sennett 's  Keystone Studios . [ 12 ]  She further collaborated with Sennett on other Keystone films and, during the late 1910s and early 1920s, she had her own movie studio and production company. [ 13 ]  Other notable actresses who became directors include  Grace Cunard  and  Nell Shipman .  The first documented Asian woman director, producer and actress is  Marion E. Wong , who created the Mandarin Film Company in 1916.  She wrote, directed, produced and acted in  The Curse of Quon Guon .\n Women screenwriters were highly sought after in the early years of the cinema.  Frances Marion ,  Anita Loos , and  June Mathis  all had successful careers in the silent and early-sound eras. Mathis was also the first female executive in  Hollywood .\n See  Mary Pickford \n \n Classical Hollywood [ edit ] \n As the American cinema became a highly commercialized industry in the 1920s and its content became more and more conventionalized, the opportunities for women producers and directors became fewer and fewer. By the time sound arrived in the US in 1927 and the years immediately after, women's roles behind the camera were largely limited to scriptwriters, costume designers, set decorators, make-up artists, and the like. And the industry's implementation of self-censorship in the form of the  Hays Code  in 1934 meant that topics such as birth control and abortion were taboo.  Dorothy Arzner  was the only woman director to survive in this unfriendly environment. She did so by producing well made but formally rather conventional films. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace feminist elements in her films. [ 14 ]  Film critics find her film,  Dance, Girl, Dance , about two women struggling to make it in show business, to be particularly interesting from a feminist perspective. When the film was selected for inclusion in the  National Film Registry , it was noted that \"The dancers, played by  Maureen O'Hara  and  Lucille Ball , strive to preserve their own feminist integrity, while fighting for their place in the spotlight and for the love of male lead  Louis Hayward .\" [ 15 ]  Beyond  Dance, Girl, Dance , Arzner also worked with some of Hollywood's most formidable actresses—including  Katharine Hepburn  in  Christopher Strong  (1933) and  Joan Crawford  in  The Bride Wore Red  (1937).\n First woman to direct a film noir,  Ida Lupino , is widely regarded as the most prominent female filmmaker working in the 1950s during the Hollywood studio system. She is best known for directing  The Hitch-Hiker . Ida Lupino is also famous for her work as an actress.\n \n Experimental and avant-garde cinema [ edit ] \n The experimental and avant-garde cinema is the genre considered to be closer to women filmmakers and one that also advances women themes. Annette Kuhn, for instance, noted such special affinity by citing that low investments of money and 'professionalism' have meant that it is more open than the mainstream film industry for women. [ 16 ]  Both  Pam Cook  and  Laura Mulvey  also noted an alignment and alliance of experimental and avant-garde cinema with feminist interest and feminist politics. Specifically, Mulvey explained that mainstream or Hollywood films are unable to provide the experience of contradiction, reinforcing anti-realism and, this is where the avant-garde cinema is useful for women and feminism because they share \"a common interest in the politics of images and problems of aesthetic language.\" [ 17 ] \n Women's involvement in the experimental and avant-garde cinema started in the early twentieth century, although it was limited due to the constraints of the social conventions of this period. [ 2 ]  It was only after the war when women became actively involved in this cinematic genre.  Germaine Dulac  was a leading member of the French avant-garde film movement after World War I. [ 18 ]  There is also the case of  Maya Deren 's visionary films, which belonged to the classics of experimental cinema and focused on the North-American avant-garde. [ 19 ]  The contemporaneous trend did not oppose the female filmmakers' entry into avant-garde filmmaking although, in its early years, they did not receive as much critical acclaim as their male counterparts. [ 2 ] \n Shirley Clarke  was a leading figure of the independent American film scene in New York in the fifties. [ 20 ]  Her work is unusual, insofar as she directed outstanding experimental and feature films as well as documentaries.  Joyce Wieland  was a Canadian  experimental film  maker. The  National Film Board of Canada  allowed many women to produce non-commercial animation films. In Europe women artists like  Valie Export  were among the first to explore the artistic and political potential of  videos . Her art works incited controversy due to sexual and feminist qualities. [ 21 ] \n \n Impact on society [ edit ] \n Faten Hamama Middle East Africa [ 22 ] [ 23 ] \n Impact of second-wave feminism [ edit ] \n In the late sixties, when the  second wave  of  feminism  started, the New Left was at its height. Both movements strongly opposed the 'dominant cinema', i.e. Hollywood and male European bourgeois auteur cinema. Hollywood was accused of furthering oppression by disseminating sexist, racist and imperialist stereotypes. Women participated in mixed new collectives like  Newsreel , but they also formed their own film groups. Early feminist films often focused on personal experiences. [ 24 ] \n Second-wave feminism would reveal itself in different forms in films in the latter part of the 20th century such as with the idea of \"sisterhoods\" in movies (however many of these movies were made by men). [ 25 ]  Other concepts of second-wave feminism in films involved women's oppression and the difficulty in identifying with the idea of femininity. During this time, feminism in movies would also be represented as a counter-cinema [ 26 ]  whereby filmmakers would attempt to intentionally deconstruct the model of the classical film. This style of feminist counter-cinema can be seen in the works of artists such as  Sally Potter 's  Thriller  in 1979.\n \n Representing sexuality [ edit ] \n Resisting the oppression of female sexuality was one of the core goals of  second-wave feminism .  Abortion  was still very controversial in many western societies and feminists opposed the control of the state and the church. Exploring female sexuality took many forms: focusing on long-time censured forms of sexuality ( lesbianism ,  sado-masochism ) or showing heterosexuality from a woman's point of view.\n Liliana Cavani ,  Birgit Hein ,  Elfi Mikesch ,  Nelly Kaplan ,  Catherine Breillat  and  Barbara Hammer  are some of the directors to be remembered.\n A film notable for its empathic portrayal of sex work is  Lizzie Borden's   Working Girls  (1986). Molly, a white lesbian in a stable mixed-race relationship, is a Yale-educated photographer who has chosen to augment her income through sex work in a low-key urban brothel. We accompany Molly on what turns out to be her last day on the job, understanding her professional interactions with her \"johns\" through her perspective, a completely original point of view, since, until Borden's film, sex workers had largely been depicted stereotypically. The story's sympathetic, well-rounded character and situation humanizes sex work, and the film itself combats the anti-pornography stance touted by many second-wave feminists, which Borden rejects as repressive. [ 27 ] \n Typically women are portrayed as dependent on other characters, overemotional, and confined to low status jobs when compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and definitely under represented. The roles that men play are the superhero, the wealthy business man or the all-powerful villain. When it comes to the roles females play they tend to be the housewife, the woman who cannot obtain a man, the slut, or the secretary. The true comparison is masculinity versus femininity. The  Bechdel test  for film is a type of litmus test that examines the representation of women in media. The three factors tested are: 1. Are there at least two women in the film who have names? 2. Do those women talk to each other? 3. Do they talk to each other about something other than a man? (Sharma & Sender, 2014). Many roles that are given to women make them either dependent on the male counterpart or limits their role. Another characteristic of their role placement is that women are twice as likely to have a life-related role rather than a work-related role. Hollywood rarely chooses to have women be the all-powerful boss or to even have a successful career. There have been some examples that break this norm, such as  The Proposal  by  Anne Fletcher . Even in these two films, the male counterpart is a strong role and in both the female lead is reliant on both actors for the storyline. Women do not stand on their own in movies and rarely are the center of attention without a male being there to steal the limelight. Some roles that have been portrayed in recent films have worked against this norm, such as Katniss in  Hunger Games  and Furiosa in  Mad Max: Fury Road  (both films are directed by men). These roles break the norm, as women typically are portrayed as dependent on other characters, overemotional, and confined to low-status jobs compared to enterprising and ambitious male characters (Bussey & Bandura, 1999). Women in cinema are grossly misrepresented and underrepresented. [ 28 ] \n \n Fear of entering cinematography [ edit ] \n Many women fear(ed) even entering the film industry, let alone produce multiple pieces of work in the industry. It is said that both male and female workers believe hiring women into the industry is taking a big chance, or being risky. [ 29 ]  There are many discriminatory acts toward women during the hiring process into the industry such as age discrimination and providing them with lower pay rates. [ 29 ]  Most women workers in the film industry only become freelancers, which in most cases prevents them from creating careers and making a living out of their film/cinematography passion. [ 30 ]  These are the fear tactics in place, whether purposely or not, to prevent women from thriving in the film industry.\n However, there is much more gendered discrimination towards women after they receive the job and actually begin to help and/or produce work. Statistics show that there are not many women in senior positions in the industry. [ 30 ]  Compared to the number of women hired, it is clearly shown that women are not given the chance to keep their jobs for long periods of time. \"However, it is notable that women lost their jobs at a rate that was six times that of men, indicating the particular and heightened vulnerability of women in the industry.\" [ 30 ]  Women are not being promoted into higher positions as often as their male counterparts and are not even given the chance to stay long enough to get promoted. These are multiple issues happening during the hiring process and even the post-hire experiences of women which may make other women fear entering the industry in the first place.\n The way women are treated in the workplace are also evidence of the inequalities against them in the film industry. Women's pay rates and expectations in their background/experience in cinematography is much different than male workers. There are many scenarios in the industry that displays the woman with more qualifications for the job than the man, yet earns less money for the same job than the man. [ 31 ]  \"It is worth noting that women in this field are significantly better qualified than their male counterparts, with a greater proportion being graduates and an even more significant difference in the numbers of women, compared to men, with higher degrees (Skillset, 2010a: 6).\" [ 30 ]  Even the women who are overqualified are treated as if they are not, resulting in them working extra hard to become better and be rewarded as their male counterparts. [ 31 ]   All of these inequalities and discrimination toward women in the film industry creates a fear for women to even want to enter the industry.\n \n Statistics [ edit ] \n A study done by USC Annenberg researched what it meant to be a female in the film industry, no matter if they were working behind the scenes or were fictional characters.  USC Annenberg looked at two test groups for films, the top 100 films every year from 2007 to 2015 and the top 100 films in 2015.\n For the top 100 films in 2015, women were leads and co-leads in 32 of them, while of the 32 films, only 3 of them included a race other than Caucasian.  Out of the thousands of speaking roles, only 32 characters were LGBT and of those characters, 40% of them were racially diverse.  Female characters were also three times more likely to be seen in a sexual context. [ 32 ] \n Behind the scenes had similar statistics to the female fictional characters.  Female directors, writers, and producers made up 19% of the 1,365 people that it took to create the top 100 films in 2015.  The percentage of female writers (11.8%) and producers (22%) can be seen as high compared to female directors (7.5%).  Of the 7.5% of female directors, three of them were African American and one was Asian. [ 32 ] \n For the top 100 films every year from 2007 until 2015, of the 800 films, 4.1% were directed by females. [ 32 ] \n \n Documentaries [ edit ] \n While there is still a gap between the percent of female and male filmmakers, women tend to be more involved in documentary films.  There is a higher percentage of women directing documentaries than women directing narrative films. [ 33 ]  There came a point where female directors were barely noticed or not recognized at all.\n \n Female filmmakers as feminists [ edit ] \n In the film world, many female filmmakers are not given much attention or chances to show what they are capable of. This issue is still being debated on, but several activists aim to change and overcome this type of inequality. These activists aim to raise awareness and produce a social change to what is currently shown in the media. During the 1990s, many films came about presenting female filmmakers from different nationalities and racial groups. [ 34 ]  For example, one of the films released that year is called  Sisters in Cinema [ 35 ]  directed by  Yvonne Welbon . This documentary was to demonstrate how African American female directors inspect their present spot in the business. By giving these female film directors the opportunity to showcase their work and demonstrate their actions then feminist documentaries will be as equally important to any other documentary. Not only this, but many documentaries tend to showcase different social activists who aim for a social change by raising awareness and reinforcing female film directors.\n \n Celluloid ceiling [ edit ] \n The Center of the Study of Women in Television and Film has dedicated 18 years to the study of women in the film industry.  An annual report is created, discussing how women have contributed to as filmmakers.  Most of the findings from the research shows that, statistically, it says the same from year to year. [ 36 ]  The highest earning movies of the past 20 years, with the exception of foreign films and reissues, have been monitored and studied by the Celluloid Ceiling to provide information on the contributions and employment of women on these films. [ 37 ]  According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University, as of 2017, \"women comprised 18% of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films.\" [ 37 ]  The same study concluded that in 2017, 10 or more women were given one of these positions in 1% of films, compared to 10 or more men being hired for these jobs in 70% of films. [ 37 ]  Information from the Celluloid Ceiling shows that more women tend to be employed on film projects directed by women. [ 37 ]  According to the Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy, \"in films with at least one female director, women comprised 53% of writers. Conversely, in films with male directors, women comprised just 10% of writers.\" [ 38 ]  Statistically, female directors generally create films about and for women, and hire women to assume the roles of main characters or protagonists. [ 38 ]  The Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy additionally found that \"in 2015, women comprised only 22% of protagonists and 18% of antagonists. Just 34% of major characters and 33% of all speaking characters in the top 100 domestic grossing films were women.\"  [ 38 ] \n The group also contributes their time to creating articles discussing how women are viewed in film, not only as filmmakers but as fictional characters as well. [ 36 ] \n \n North America [ edit ] \n Canada [ edit ] \n Mary Harron  is a famous woman director from Canada who is active in Hollywood. She first gained recognition with the film  I Shot Andy Warhol  which premiered at the  1996 Cannes Film Festival . She also directed  American Psycho  (2000) and  The Notorious Bettie Page  (2005).\n Joyce Wieland  is a notable Canadian experimental filmmaker and mixed media artist. She was active from 1950s until 1980s as a filmmaker. In recent years the actress-turned filmmaker  Sarah Polley  has made several notable films. In 2022, she wrote and directed the film  Women Talking , based on the  2018 novel of the same name  by  Miriam Toews , for which she won the  Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay . [ 39 ] \n \n United States [ edit ] \n Hollywood [ edit ] \n Silent era [ edit ] \n \n In the silent film era American women were heavily involved in cinema in all occupations.\n Helen Gardner  was the first film actor, male or female, to form her own production company, \"The Helen Gardner Picture Players\". The first feature film by the company was the 1912 film  Cleopatra , which she produced and starred in. [ 8 ] \n American director,  Lois Weber  is one of the most prolific film directors and producers of the silent era. [ 9 ]  Weber is well known for her films  Hypocrites  (1915),  The Blot  (1921), and  Suspense  (1913).\n Mabel Normand  was another notable early female filmmaker. She started as an actress and became a producer and director in the 1910s. [ 12 ]  During the late 1910s and early 1920s, she had her own movie studio and production company. [ 13 ]  Other notable actresses who became directors include  Grace Cunard  and  Nell Shipman .\n \n 1940s-1950s [ edit ] \n \n Dorothy Arzner  was the one of the very few women in executive positions to be successful from 1920s until 1940s Hollywood. From 1927 until 1943, Arzner was the only woman director working in Hollywood. [ 14 ] \n First woman to direct a film noir,  Ida Lupino , is widely regarded as the most prominent female filmmaker working in the 1950s during the Hollywood studio system. Besides directing, she was also an actress.\n Ukrainian born American filmmaker  Maya Deren  directed groundbreaking avant-garde and experimental films in the 1940s including  Meshes of the Afternoon  (1943). [ 19 ] \n \n 1960s-1970s [ edit ] \n Girlfriends \n Shirley Clarke  was an important and innovative independent filmmaker who shot three feature films in the 1960s —  The Connection  (1961),  The Cool World  (1964) and  Portrait of Jason  (1967).\n The 1970 film  Wanda  by  Barbara Loden  is one of the most poignant portraits of alienation in cinema. [ 24 ] \n Joyce Chopra  achieved success as a documentary and feature film director in the 1970s and 1980s. Her film  Smooth Talk  won the Grand Jury Prize in the Dramatic category at the 1986 Sundance Festival. She also collaborated with director Claudia Weill on her documentary film  Joyce at 34  which documented her giving birth. [ 40 ] \n Critically acclaimed 1978 film  Girlfriends  by  Claudia Weill  is a highlight of 1970s women's cinema. In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". Due to workplace sexual harassment from producer  Ray Stark  on the set of her follow-up film  It's My Turn  (1980), Weill stopped making feature films. [ 40 ] \n Elaine May ,  Joan Darling ,  Joan Tewkesbury ,  Joan Micklin Silver ,  Karen Arthur  and  Martha Coolidge  are some other notable 1970s film directors.\n \n 1980s-2000s [ edit ] \n \n Barbra Streisand , best known as an actress and singer, directed the film  Yentl  in 1983, thus becoming the first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film. She was the first woman to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Director in 1983.\n Film director  Julie Dash  achieved great commercial and critical success with her 1991 hit film  Daughters of the Dust  which was an award winner at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n Kathryn Bigelow  works in traditionally male-dominated genres like science fiction, action and horror. Her directorial debut was the 1981 biker drama  The Loveless . She became the first woman to win an  Academy Award for Best Director  and the  Directors Guild of America Award  in 2010 for  The Hurt Locker . [ 1 ] [ 41 ]  In 2013, her film  Zero Dark Thirty  was met with universal acclaim [ 42 ]  and grossed $95 million in the United States box office. [ 43 ]  Bigelow went on to be nominated for Best Director at the  BAFTA Awards ,  Golden Globe Awards  and  Directors Guild of America Award  among others. However, she failed to be shortlisted for the category at the  85th Academy Awards  in what was widely seen as a  snub . [ 44 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] \n Lizzie Borden  is a notable 1980s feminist filmmaker who made films on controversial topics, including sex-work. Some of her notable films include  Born in Flames  (1983) and  Working Girls  (1986).\n \n 2000s-present [ edit ] \n \n In the 2000s women directed films made in Hollywood have started making more money than ever, with highest grossing films getting 100 million or even up to billion dollar grosses.\n Anne Fletcher  has directed seven studio-financed films:  Step Up  (2006),  27 Dresses  (2008),  The Proposal  (2009)  The Guilt Trip  (2012),  Hot Pursuit  (2015),  Dumplin'  (2018), and  Hocus Pocus 2  (2022) which have gone on to gross over $343 million at the US  box office  and $632 million worldwide. [ 47 ] \n Catherine Hardwicke 's films have grossed a cumulative total of $551.8 million. [ 48 ]  Her most successful films are  Twilight  (2008) and  Red Riding Hood  (2011).\n Nancy Meyers  has enjoyed success with her five features:  The Parent Trap  (1998),  What Women Want  (2000),  Something's Gotta Give  (2003),  The Holiday  (2006) and  It's Complicated  (2009) which have amassed $1,157 million worldwide. [ 49 ]  Before she started her directorial career she wrote some other successful films like  Private Benjamin  (1980) for which she was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay ,  Baby Boom  (1987) or  Father of the Bride  (1991).\n Sofia Coppola  is a critically acclaimed director who has also had financial success.

[ 50 ] \n \n African American women's cinema [ edit ] \n \n Julie Dash 's  Daughters of the Dust  (1991) was the first full-length film with general theatrical release written and directed by an  African American  woman. Since then there have been several African or African-American women who have written, produced or directed films with national release.  Neema Barnette  ( Civil Brand ),  Maya Angelou  ( Down in the Delta ),  Kasi Lemmons  ( Eve's Bayou ),  Cheryl Dunye  ( My Baby's Daddy ),  Stephanie Allain  ( Biker Boyz ),  Tracey Edmonds  ( Soul Food ),  Frances-Anne Solomon  ( A Winter Tale ) and  Dianne Houston  ( City of Angels ),  Leslie Harris  ( Just Another Girl on the IRT ) are among these filmmakers. In 1994 Darnell Martin became the first African American woman to write and direct a film produced by a major studio when Columbia Pictures backed  I Like It Like That . [ 51 ] \n To date,  Nnegest Likké  is the first  African American  woman to write, direct and act in a full-length movie released by a major studio,  Phat Girlz  (2006) starring  Jimmy Jean-Louis  and  Mo'Nique .\n For a much fuller accounting of the larger history of black women filmmakers, see Yvonne Welbon's 62-minute documentary  Sisters in Cinema  (2003). [ 52 ] \n Furthermore, since the revolutionary start of filmmaking, black women filmmakers have continuously struggled and are still struggling to showcase their work on feature films in Hollywood. [ 53 ]  However, that does not exclude the fact that there were various black women filmmakers who sparked during their time and age because of their phenomenal work behind the scenes. [ 53 ]   Jessie Maple  is considered to be one of the most recognized figure for the civil rights of the African American community and women of color within the film industry. [ 53 ]  Her film career took off when she first worked as a film editor for the crime drama film  Shaft's Big Score  (1972) and  The Super Cops  (1974) which was based on a book. She continued to work as a film editor for several years but eventually became the only black union cameraperson in her time in New York. [ 53 ]  With her devoted passion for film and activism growing by the day, Maple and her husband, Leroy Patton, created LJ Film productions, Inc. and when on about to produce several short documentaries within the border and context of black representation, such as  Black Economic Power: Reality or Fantasy?  (1977). [ 53 ]  Her two major works,  Will  (1988) and  Twice as Nice  (1988), were the first ever independent feature films to be solely created and directed by an African American woman. [ 53 ] \n Alile Sharon Larkin  is known as a film director, producer, and writer. She began her film career while earning her master's degree in UCLA in film and television production. [ 53 ]  One of her first films called  Your Children Come Back to You  (1979) depicts the ongoing dilemma that a young African American girl faces while choosing between her aunt's desire to take in a European lifestyle while her mother is strictly intact with her African roots and culture. [ 53 ]  Larkin's second film feature  A Different Image  (1982) gained her popular recognition and praise, and eventually won a first-place prize from the  Black American Cinema Society . [ 53 ]  Her ongoing success in the film industry gave her the potential and opportunity to form her own production studio in order to create and enhance educational videos and television for young children. [ 53 ] Dreadlocks and the Three Bears  (1992) and  Mz Medusa  (1998) are some of the productions produced in her studio during the 1990s. [ 53 ] \n \n Africa [ edit ] \n Shadia \n The Cameroonian journalist  Thérèse Sita-Bella  directed a 1963 documentary,  Tam-Tam à Paris , and  Sarah Maldoror , a French filmmaker of Guadeloupean descent, shot the feature-film  Sambizanga  in Angola in 1972. But the first African woman film director to gain international recognition was the  Senegalese   ethnologist   Safi Faye  with a film about the village in which she was born ( Letter from the Village , 1975). The 1989  Créteil International Women's Film Festival  included short films by  Leonie Yangba Zowe  of the  Central African Republic  ( Yangba-Bola  and  Lengue , 1985) and  Flora M'mbugu-Schelling  of  Tanzania . [ 54 ]  Other African women filmmakers include  Anne Mungai ,  Fanta Régina Nacro  ( The Night of Truth , 2004), Tsitsi Dangarembga ( Mother's Day , 2004) and  Marguerite Abouet , an Ivorian graphic novel writer who co-directed an animated film based on her graphic novel:  Aya de Yopougon  (2012). The most successful film in the history of  Nollywood ,  The Wedding Party , was directed by  Kemi Adetiba  in 2016.\n Cameroonian-Belgian Rosine Mbakam, who directed two feature-length documentaries,  The Two Faces of a Bamiléké Woman  (2016) and  Chez Jolie Coiffure  (2018), has been described as \"one of the foremost filmmakers of creative nonfiction working right now.\" [ 55 ] \n \n Asia [ edit ] \n India [ edit ] \n The Indian film industry has been an ongoing success since the revolutionary start of their musicals and romantic family dramas. Majority of these popular \"Masala\" films are usually directed by men. [ 56 ]  Female roles in the filmmaking industry were solely restricted to acting, singing and dancing. However, recently women have stepped up and took the lead as successful directors, producing films mainly revolving around female issues within society. [ 56 ]  Like majority of women around the world, Women in India have been struggling to prove their point. [ 56 ]  Films made by women were usually categorized as art films or films of the parallel cinema. Indian women filmmakers could not have full access to funds and film publicity like male filmmakers did. [ 56 ]  Mainstream cinema in India basically consists of the \" Masala Movies \", which includes several genres such as comedy, action, revenge, tragedy, romance combined to create an entire film. [ 56 ]  Women continuously face struggles with attempting to get a fraction of the millions of dollars spend of these masala films. [ 56 ]  This forces women to drift away from the masala genre in order to get some recognition, which can often cause controversies and raises suspicion. [ 56 ] \n A number of well-known Indian female filmmakers have achieved astounding commercial success from their films, including  Mira Nair  (active in America),  Aparna Sen ,  Deepa Mehta  (active in Canada),  Gurinder Chadha  (active in the UK), and  Manju Borah . However, there are a number of other Indian women filmmakers who have made some remarkable films that go beyond just entertainment; they take advantage of their platform to address a range of social and political issues. [ 57 ]  Other noteworthy Indian women filmmakers include  Vijaya Nirmala ,  Nisha Ganatra ,  Sonali Gulati ,  Indu Krishnan ,  Eisha Marjara ,  Pratibha PJaaparmar ,  Nandini Sikand ,  Ish Amitoj Kaur ,  Harpreet Kaur ,  Leena Manimekalai  and  Shashwati Talukdar ,  Rima Das .\n \n \n Deepa Mehta  is a transnational filmmaker whose work in film is recognized internationally at the highest levels. She is mainly active in Canada since 1973. Her moving films have been played at almost every major film festival. [ 58 ]  She produced the film  Heaven on Earth , in 2008, which premiered at the  Toronto International Film Festival . Since its release, the film has turned into a useful tool for professionals who specialize in assisting abused women, specifically looking at the circumstances of immigrant women in abusive environments, as it has been screened at conferences of crown attorneys, judges and healthcare workers in order to help them better understand these women's situations. [ 57 ]   Fire  is a story of two sisters in law who go against their traditions and culture aiming to begin a new life together. [ 56 ]  When the movie was first screened in Bombay, it caused a backlash by a few political parties such as the  Shiv Sena . [ 56 ]  Majority of the theaters stopped screening the film because of the violent mob attacks which caused serious damage to the theatre hall and property. [ 56 ]  The attackers did not want the film to be screened because it went against their beliefs and was a violation to \"Indian culture\". [ 56 ]  The Indian society is still not equipped to understand and accept gay and lesbian relationships into their community. On the other hand, there are some who praised Mehta's film for showcasing social issues India was facing.\n Some of her other well-known works include her elemental trilogy:  Earth  (1996),  Fire  (1998),  Water  (2005), where dominant masculine values and practices of oppression and exploitation of women are challenged in this compelling three part series. [ 59 ]  Mehta's film  Earth (1998)  was inspired from  Bapsi Sidhwa 's \" Cracking India \", which was a story revolving the India-Pakistan Partition of 1947 and had a successful outcome. [ 56 ]  Mehta began working on her last film,  Water (2005) , in her trilogy. The movie was set in the 1930s when India was fighting for independence against the British colonial rule. [ 56 ]  The film portrays a group of widows who struggle with poverty in the city of  Varanasi . [ 56 ]  It also looks at the dynamic between one of the widows, who aims to be free from the social restrictions forced upon widows and a man who is from a lower social class and is a follower of Mahatma Gandhi. [ 56 ]  Feminist social issues are highlighted, such as the mistreatment of widows, religious misogyny, and child brides in rural parts of India. [ 57 ]  Mehta was forced to stop the film production because of the political party of Hindu extremists in relation to  Bharatiya Janatha Party  (BJP), responded by stating that the film tarnishes India's image and was associated in organizing attempt by the Christian church to revolt against  Hinduism . [ 56 ]  She received an Oscar Nomination for  Water  in 2007. [ 60 ]  Other notable films of hers are  Bollywood/Hollywood  (2002), and the adaptation of  Midnight's Children  (2012). [ 58 ] \n Mira Nair , an accomplished Indian filmmaker, has written, produced and directed a plethora of documentaries. Her unique ability to provoke both western and non-western viewers in a variety of ways has led her to be seen as a non-traditional filmmaker who is not afraid of creating controversy through her work. [ 61 ]   So Far From India  (1983) depicted the story of a young, working Indian immigrant in New York City and his harrowing experience of acculturation. While dealing with his own new struggles in America, he also has to worry about his pregnant wife back home. [ 61 ]   India Cabaret  (1986), is a documentary-style film that lent a voice to strippers or cabaret dancers in  Mumbai . [ 61 ]  Beyond these impressive works, she also has a list of feature films under her belt; her debut feature film,  Salaam Bombay!  (1988), which detailed the urban devastation created by prostitution and poverty, was nominated for an  Academy Award  for Best Foreign Language Film in 1988, won the Prix du Publique for most popular entry at the  Cannes Film Festival , the  Camera D'Or  for best first feature, as well as 25 other international awards. [ 62 ] \n Majority of female filmmakers in India try to change the film industry by bringing in real social issues, instead of the mainstream masala movies that India has been known for. [ 56 ]  Daman (2001) is directed by Lajma who decided to take on a unique yet distinct theme by raising awareness about marital rape. [ 56 ]  The leading actress won an award for her outstanding raw performance that revived Indian films that try to raise awareness regarding a serious social issue. [ 56 ] \n \n Lebanon [ edit ] \n  \n Journalist and director  Jocelyne Saab  is considered to be a pioneer of Lebanese cinema. She began her career in the 1970s. She directed both documentary and fiction films.\n Heiny Srour  was the first Arab woman filmmaker to have her film,  The Hour of Liberation Has Arrived , screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1974.\n Danielle Arbid  is a Lebanese-French filmmaker whose work has been screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Her feature film debut was  In the Battlefields  (2004).\n Nadine Labaki  is a notable Lebanese film director. Her debut feature film  Caramel  premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.\n Noura Kevorkian  is an Armenian-Lebanese-Syrian writer-director-producer.

[ 63 ]  She completed her undergraduate studies in the  American University in Cairo  then continued to pursue her master's degree in film production from the  University of Sydney  in Australia. [ 63 ]  One of her three successful short films, Women Without Shadows, inspired hundreds of uprising Saudi filmmakers as well as raising questions towards the issue of publicly opening cinemas in Saudi. [ 63 ]  Her films have been both celebrated and criticized due to the fact that her work brings serious social topics Saudis are struggling with regarding their conservative culture and traditions. [ 64 ] \n In  Wadjda , the main character, Waad Mohammed decides to go against social norms imposed on a ten-year-old girl in the kingdom. She becomes an outcast because of the bicycle she rides in public. [ 64 ]  However, the film ends on a light and inspiring note that frees Wadjda from all the social constraints set upon her.  Haifa al Mansour  reflects a portion of the Saudi society that refuses to accept the submissive traditional way of living. [ 64 ]  However, Wadjda promotes an amount of freedom for female rights that need more than an overnight change in such a conservative and restricted culture. [ 64 ] \n \n Japan [ edit ] \n \n In Japan for a long time  Kinuyo Tanaka  was the only woman to make feature films. As a director she was active in the 1950s and 1960s.

Conventional film industry has directors like  Sangeeta  and  Shamim Ara  who are making films with feminist themes. Especially to Sangeeta's credit there are some issue-based films. Now some new directors from television industry are also coming towards the medium of films.  Sabiha Sumar  and  Mehreen Jabbar  are two new names for films in Pakistan. Both of these directors have made films which are not only issue based addressing national issues but also these films have won international awards at different film festivals.\n \n Iran [ edit ] \n \n Rakhshan Bani-Etemad , a writer and a director, is probably Iran's best known and certainly most prolific female filmmaker. She has established herself as the elder stateswoman of Iranian cinema with documentaries and films dealing with social pathology. Contemporary Iranian poet  Forugh Farrokhzad  (1935—1967) was also a filmmaker.

[ 76 ]  The most prolific Argentine woman filmmaker of the period arguably was  Renée Oro  who, unlike her peers, specialized in  documentaries , a genre highly dominated by men. [ 77 ]  The first film directed by a woman was  Un romance argentino  (1915) by Angélica García de García Mansilla, financed by the Women's Commission of the San Fernando Hospital in  Buenos Aires . [ 78 ]  The first female filmmakers in the country emerged through  philanthropic  organizations, a typical activity for women from the  upper classes . [ 79 ]  These all-women institutions, known as  sociedades de beneficencia  (English: \"societies of beneficence\"), promoted festivals in which, in addition to showing the films, there were theatrical or musical numbers. [ 79 ]  Other pioneers include  Emilia Saleny , Antonieta Capurro de Renauld, Elena Sansinena de Elizalde and María B. de Celestini, among others. [ 78 ] \n The first woman director of sound films in Argentina was  Vlasta Lah , who directed  Las furias  (1960) and  Las modelos  (1963).

[ 85 ]   Mimí Derba  founded one of the first Mexican production companies, Azteca Films. She had a successful career in  vaudeville  before entering films. Derba was the first female director in Mexico. Then  Matilde Landeta  was a Mexican filmmaker and screenwriter, who was the first female to serve in those roles during the  Golden Age of Mexican cinema . Her films focused on the portrayal of strong, realistic female protagonists in a patriarchal world. Landeta won an  Ariel Award  in 1957 for Best Original Story for the film  El camino de la vida  which she co-wrote with her brother Eduardo. The film also won the 1957 Golden Ariel, the Silver Ariel Film of Major National Interest and Best Direction and two other awards in 1956 in the  Berlin International Film Festival  under the name of  Alfonso Corona Blake . [ 86 ]  In the 1980s and 1990s things started to take a turn. Women filmmakers in Mexico finally got the opportunity to create and produce professional feature films. [ 85 ]  The most popular two would be  El secreto de Romeila  (1988) directed by  Busi Cortés  and  Los pasos de Ana  (1990) by Marisa Sistach. [ 85 ]  These two feature films were considered the doors that opened opportunity for women filmmakers in Mexico as well as created a new genre that people were not familiar with, labeled as 'women's cinema'. [ 85 ]  The phenomenal growth of 'women's cinema' not only meant that there would be an infinite expansion in the list of female names as filmmakers or creators; in reality, it created a daunting cinematic genre by objectifying women as well as displacing them within the film industry. [ 85 ] \n \n Arcelia Ramírez Verónica Instructions Not Included Such Is Life \n Most of the female filmmakers in Mexico recognize as feminists. The primary reason for many of them to commit to being filmmakers was to depict stories of women in their original and true essence as well as to strive in readapting roles of females on the Mexican screen. [ 85 ]  According to Patricia Torres San Martín, an honorable film scholar, there is a new theme emerging within the film industry in Mexico which is known as the 'new female identity'. [ 85 ]  This new structural change in cinema created a geographical cultural change in Mexico due to its new emerged eye-opening concept in the film industry. [ 85 ]  One of  Maria Novaro  first short films (a school work:  An Island Surrounded by Water , 1984) was acquired by the  Museum of Modern Art in New York  for its permanent film collection and was distributed in the United States by Women Make Movies. Maria's 1994  El Jardín del Edén  (The Garden of Eden) obtain her a second nomination for the  Ariel Award for Best Picture  the first for a woman in Mexico. In the Garden of Eden, three very different women find themselves in the Mexican-American border town of Tijuana, each with her own goal. The women: struggling artist Elizabeth ( Rosario Sagrav ), Jane ( Renée Coleman ), who's looking for her brother, and Serena ( Gabriela Roel ), a widow who just arrived in town with her family in tow. Although the trio come from different cultural backgrounds—Serena is Mexican, Jane is American and Elizabeth is Mexican-American—all three are similarly in search of a new direction.\n Mariana Chenillo  became the first female director to win an  Ariel Award  for Best Picture back in 2010 for the film  Nora's Will . The Ariel is the Mexican Academy of Film Award. In cinema, it is considered Mexico's equivalent to the Academy Awards (\"Oscars\") of the United States. The film's plot revolves around a mysterious photograph left under a bed which leads to an unexpected outcome.  Issa López  wrote the scripts for several film features, three of them produced in Mexico by the Major Hollywood Studios, and two of those directed by herself;  Efectos Secundarios  ( Warner Bros. , 2006) and  Casi Divas  Almost Divas ( Sony Pictures , 2008). Casi Divas is the only Mexican movie to be scored by acclaimed Hollywood composer  Hans Zimmer .\n \n Europe [ edit ] \n Belgium [ edit ] \n In Belgium, French language is the second most used, and many Belgian filmmakers choose to shoot their films in French, thus their films often gain popularity in France.\n \n \n Chantal Akerman  is the most famous Belgian director.

[ 91 ]   Germaine Dulac  was around  Avant-Garde  cinema during the 1920s. [ 91 ]  Lastly,  Agnés Varda  (1954) came along the movement of the  New Wave . [ 91 ] \n Among the best known French women film makers are  Agnès Varda ,  Claire Denis ,  Alice Guy-Blaché ,  Germaine Dulac ,  Jacqueline Audry ,  Catherine Breillat ,  Nelly Kaplan  and  Diane Kurys . Others include  Julia Ducournau ,  Céline Sciamma ,  Mia Hansen-Løve ,  Mati Diop ,  Pascale Ferran ,  Agnès Jaoui ,  Noémie Lvovsky ,  Tonie Marshall ,  Coline Serreau ,  Danièle Huillet  and  Danièle Thompson .\n \n Silent era — 1920s [ edit ] \n \n In the silent era French women directors were highly prominent.  Alice Guy-Blaché  directed around 700 films and is credited with introducing the narrative form with her film  La Fée aux Choux  (1896).\n Alice Guy was a secretary to  Leon Gaumont  before the making of her very own first film, which was a year later after the birth of cinema, 1854 to be exact. [ 91 ] \n Since Alice Guy was working for Gaumont, she was responsible in the production side of the company for being the director, the filmmaker, and set manger. From being a secretary to a head she had created 406 films during this period of time. [ 91 ]   Most of her films were between 20 and 90 minutes, for a film to be created for this long during this time would be considered to be a short film, but knowing the fact that it was made earlier before is exceptional during the early years. [ 91 ]  Alice Guy had the chance to shoot some of her films in a different way than Gaumont's forerunner the  Lumiere Brothers . The brothers were mostly interested in shooting films which would show what the cameras can capture on a technical level and not what they can express in a deeper extent; for example having repetitive and monotonous shots of trains or the military marching. [ 91 ]  Guy was not so interested in repetitiveness in films, although she was slightly influenced by them, she had decided to think of something better and comedic. [ 91 ]  Here she gave in a bunch of short comedic films to Gaumont and he approved of her films. [ 91 ]  In 1906 she directed the comedic short film  The Consequences of Feminism  which depicted a world where traditional gender roles are inverted. Within a year of her submission of short films, they have become a complete success. Her film  La Passion  or so called  La Vie du Christ  (1906) was a work of art on which she has worked on for years. This has included 25 sets along with a number if exterior areas and around or over 300 crowd scenes. [ 91 ] \n Germaine Dulac  was one of the most creative art film directors and went on to be the leader of the French cinéclub movement. [ 92 ]  Dulac had studied music first then became a film logician and a journalist. She focused closely on still photography just before the making of her very own first film in the year 1926. [ 91 ] \n At the time where Germain Dulac was shooting to make her first film in 1916, the film industry in France was in an unusual state because of the early booming that has happened in 1901–1904. [ 91 ]  During 1910, around sixty to seventy percent of films were sent out worldwide from Paris, however, during 1914 the industry started to decline these films because it lacked investment and production tools for practices. [ 91 ]  Later on over the years in 1920, the new cinema in France began because of avant-garde filmmaking and the first movement of film theory, in which Dulac was interested in. [ 91 ]  Dulac started off as a journalist for feminist journals  La Fraciase  and  La Fronde  and later became interested in still photography which made her contemplate about the connection between the camera lens and feminism. [ 91 ]  She was highly influenced by music in her early life, which she incorporated in films to visually see the movement of music. [ 91 ]  She had made her films sound poetic to show and express emotion and her experience as a feminist journalist affected her work when depicting female characters. [ 91 ]  One of her best known films is  La Souriante Madame Beudet  ( The Smiling Madame Beudet ) created in 1923 which came to be a landmark feminist film. The film's plot revolves around a hard-working female in a loveless marriage. [ 91 ] \n Musidora  was another French film pioneer—she was an actress, film director and screenwriter.

[ 99 ] \n \n Russia [ edit ] \n Russian Empire and Soviet Union Era [ edit ] \n \n Russian cinematography has seen a number of women directors who created nationally and internationally acclaimed movies. The first Russian moving picture produced by a female director came out in 1910s.  Olga Preobrazhenskaya  was introduced into the fledgling film industry by  Yakov Protazanov . In 1913 Olga Preobrazhenskaya began directing films in the \"Timan and Reingardt\" studio. Her first work as a director was a joint effort with actor, screenwriter and director  Vladimir Gardin —in 1916, they filmed  Miss Peasant  based on the work of the same name by  Pushkin . As Olga Preobrazhenskaya put it, \"the film came out, it was praised, but since it was the first production of a woman director, it was treated with distrust, and on the posters and reviews my name was often written with a male ending or attributed to the production of other directors.\" [ 100 ]  In the first years after the Revolution, Olga Preobrazhenskaya was also the first woman to teach directing: she taught classes at the  State School of Cinematography (now VGIK) . Preobrazhenskaya's most successful work is the drama  Women of Ryazan  (1927), which the writer Theodore Dreiser, who visited the USSR at the time, called a miracle. The film was about the difficult life of an ordinary Russian peasant woman in the countryside on the eve and after the revolution. Preobrazhenskaya created this picture together with the director Ivan Pravov, as many of her other films, designed in the spirit of socialist realism:  And Quiet Flows the Don ,  Stepan Razin ,\n The Lad from the Taiga .\n Brumberg sisters  were pioneer animators. They were active between 1925 and 1970. In a career lasting almost 50 years, they created around 50 films as animation directors, animators and screenwriters.\n Nadezhda Kosheverova  was considered the greatest fairy tale director of the Soviet cinema. In spite of the fact that the director tried herself in different genres, from realistic ( Galya ) to comedies ( Tamer of Tigers ), it was in the fairy tale genre that her talent revealed itself most fully. The most famous of her ten works in this genre is  Cinderella  released in 1947, filmed together with Mikhail Shapiro on the script of  Evgeny Schwartz .  Cinderella  was, perhaps, the first fairy tale in the history of the Soviet cinema, devoid of any ideological overtones, but at the same time reflecting with mild satire the features of the Soviet way of life. For example, in the stepmother, played by  Faina Ranevskaya , one may easily recognize the exemplary communal activist. And also for the first time in the Soviet cinema aristocratic heroes—King Erast Garin and Prince Alexei Konsovsky—are not portrayed as caricatured negative characters.\n Margarita Barskaya  was the first director who succeeded in showing the world through the eyes of a child. In 1933, she released  Tattered Shoes , the first sound film for children in the history of the world cinema. It told the story of children growing up in a conventional European country where the fascist regime came to power. After the film's release, Barskaya was immediately talked about as a new, original talent, and much later, almost as a forerunner of Italian neo-realism. Viewers were delighted by how casually children behaved in the frame, as if not noticing the lens—the credit goes to Barskaya who developed her own system of working with young actors. Margarita Barskaya was the initiator of the world's first children's film studio \"Soyuzdetfilm\", where a full-length film  Father and Son  was shot. It never appeared on the screens: the critics branded the picture as \"fake\", because Barskaya, true to her style, reflected the life of a Soviet family without embellishment. The director was no longer allowed to shoot—mainly because of her friendship with the disgraced oppositionist Karl Radek, as a result, the film  Father and Son  was the last work of Barskaya.\n Filmmaker  Yulia Solntseva , before becoming a famous director, managed to attract attention as an actress thanks to her main roles in silent films  Aelita  and  The Cigarette Girl from Mosselprom . The most famous work of Solntseva was  Poem of the Sea , filmed in 1958 from a script by her husband, director  Alexander Dovzhenko , in which the director presented the construction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric station in the style of an ancient Greek epic. Another notable work by Solntseva was the first wide-screen film in Europe,  Chronicle of Flaming Years  (1960), which won the award for best director at Cannes.\n Iskra Babich , a 1958 graduate of VGIK, was a favorite student of director and teacher  Ivan Pyryev . She had only four full-length films in her filmography – all four melodramas. Babich made penetrating films about love, conscience and kindness—but without excessive expression and eccentric plots. The director's most famous film is  Muzhiki!  (1982), which won many awards and achieved international recognition.\n Dinara Asanova , a student of  Mikhail Romm , is known as a director who accurately shows the conflicting nature of an adolescent. Two of her most famous films—a lyrical story about unrequited love  Woodpeckers Don't Get Headaches  (1975) and a drama about young hooligans  Boys  (1983), which featured amateur actors, real troubled teens. After the movie Asanova began to receive packs of letters: people were asking for advice, believing that the director was a qualified specialist in the education of \"difficult children\". However, Asanova's only task was to show that the transition period between adolescence and youth is not a rehearsal for \"real\", adult life, but an important part of our only, big, life.\n Larisa Shepitko  was one of the central figures of the Soviet cinema in the 1960s and '70s. One of her most acclaimed films,  Wings , released in 1966, reflected on the fate of front-line soldiers. The war veteran in the film was a woman, a former aviator Nadezhda Petrukhina, who after the war became the director of a vocational school. The main character, forced to abandon the sky, had to live by the new rules, which did not have the moral clarity inherent in wartime, which eventually brought her to an existential dead end, like many in her generation. In order to shoot her main film,  The Ascension  (1976), Shepitko had to confront the authorities. The film became the first Soviet picture to win the \"Golden Bear\" at the Berlin International Film Festival.\n Tatiana Lukashevich debuted as a film director at the age of 24: her film  Ivan Karavaev's Crime  was more like an artistically designed film propaganda than an artistic statement, but it still drew attention to the young director. Later Lukashevich made mostly films that contributed to the \"moral education of the younger generation\" (\"Gavrosh\", \"The Foundling\", \"The Maturity Certificate\"). Despite the director's strict adherence to the canons of socialist realism, such values as humanity and genuineness were always in the foreground in Lukashevich's films. This is most noticeable in the film The Foundling, whose main idea is expressed in the lines of a lullaby: \"In our big city, everyone is kind to the baby.\"\n For Aida Manasarova, perhaps the most important thing in her work was the careful avoidance of everything too idealistic and far-fetched. According to Manasarova, it was \"much more important for her to show the real drama of the search for moral ideals,\" so her characters were never one-dimensional and positive. Almost all of her films told about people experiencing a deep inner crisis. \"I like heroes who are tormented by their imperfection,\" Manasarova admitted. One of the highlights of the directors works is a family drama \"Look away\" (1983) about the difficult relationship between mother and son.\n Seventeen Moments of Spring , one of the most famous and nationally acclaimed series known in the Soviet cinema, was also made by a female director  Tatyana Lioznova . However, the director is known not only for the story of the popular Soviet spy. A key character in all her works was a man who finds himself in unnatural conditions, a white crow, who is tested for his resilience, and not always successfully. Nyura from the film  Three Poplars in Plyushchikha  in 1967 who never found love; Nina from  Carnival  (1981) who returned to her small town, not having achieved any success as a great actress; Lenya from the film  We, below  (1980) who failed at collecting the signatures he so badly needed. This combination of stubbornness and humility is characteristic of her films. As the playwright Alexander Gelman put it, \"her films are sincere, the truth of the soul in them surpasses the truth of facts, as it happens in life with real people.\"\n Alla Surikova  is notable for directing many successful comedy films. Her most popular film is the satiric Red-Western  A Man from the Boulevard des Capucines  (1987).\n Kira Muratova  always strove to make films which she herself wanted to create, irrespective of changes of political agenda, regimes and aesthetic guidelines. This led to her first films— Brief Encounters  (1967) and  The Long Farewell  (1971) getting shelved; the third,  Getting to Know the Big, Wide World  (1979), was never shown in wide distribution, and the fourth,  Among Grey Stones  (1983), heavily cut down by censorship, and released under the pseudonym of Ivan Sidorov. Finally,  The Asthenic Syndrome  (1989), released as Muratova wanted, brought her worldwide acclaim. Today Muratova is one of the most acclaimed Soviet directors.\n \n Post-Soviet Era [ edit ] \n \n There are many new and important names in the strong Russian female tradition of filmmaking in the 21-century, and the number is constantly increasing.\n Svetlana Baskova  gained nationwide notoriety for directing the  exploitation  shock-horror film  The Green Elephant  in 1999.\n Renata Litvinova , initially famous as an actress in Kira Muratova's films, honed her directorial skills in  Goddess: How I fell in Love  (2004) and  The Last Tale of Rita .

In 1910 she directed the short drama,  Värmländingarna , which premièred in Sweden on 27 October 1910. Another Swedish film pioneer is  Anna Hofman-Uddgren  who directed  Stockholmsfrestelser  in 1911. Swedish actress  Mai Zetterling  directed a number of films in the 1960s and 1970s.\n A notable recent film made by a female Swedish film director,  Pleasure  (2021) by Ninja Thyberg, was screened at Sundance Film Festival.\n \n United Kingdom [ edit ] \n \n Joy Batchelor  was an English animator, director, screenwriter, and producer. She married  John Halas  in 1940, [ 102 ]  and subsequently co-established  Halas and Batchelor  cartoons, whose best known production is the animated feature film  Animal Farm  (1954), which made her the first woman director of an animated feature since  Lotte Reiniger .\n Muriel Box  was an English screenwriter and director, directing her first film in 1941.

[ 103 ] \n In Britain  Jane Arden  (1927–82), following up her television drama  The Logic Game  (1965), wrote and starred in the film  Separation  ( Jack Bond  1967), which explores a woman's mental landscape during a marital breakup. Arden went on to be the only British woman to gain a solo feature-directing credit for  The Other Side of the Underneath  (1972), a disturbing study of female madness shot mainly in South Wales. Arden's overtly feminist work was neglected and almost lost until the  British Film Institute  rediscovered and reissued her three features, and the short  Vibration  (1974), in 2009.\n Andrea Arnold  won a 2005 Academy Award for her short film  Wasp , and has won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival three times; in 2006 for  Red Road , in 2009 for  Fish Tank  and in 2016 for  American Honey .\n Two of  Lynne Ramsay 's early short films ( Small Deaths  and  Gasman ) won the Prix du Jury at the Cannes Film Festival, and her subsequent four feature films,  Ratcatcher  (1999),  Morvern Callar  (2002),  We Need to Talk About Kevin  (2011), and  You Were Never Really Here  (2017) have all screened at the Cannes Festival.\n Georgina Willis  made her debut at Cannes with the independently produced controversial feminist film  Watermark  (2003).

[ 107 ] \n \n Oceania [ edit ] \n Australia [ edit ] \n \n Increased government funding for the  film industry in Australia  in the 1970s led to a renaissance in cinema, and, as part of the growing  feminist movement in Australia  at that time, women's cinema grew. The role of women's films was discussed at the Women's Liberation Conference in  Melbourne  in 1970, [ 108 ]  and groups such as the Feminist Film Workers collective (1970s and 1980s), Sydney Women\"s Film Group (SWFG, 1972–), Melbourne Women's Film Group (1973–), Reel Women (1979 to 1983 in Melbourne), and  Women's Film Unit (Sydney and Melbourne, 1984/5) were established.
