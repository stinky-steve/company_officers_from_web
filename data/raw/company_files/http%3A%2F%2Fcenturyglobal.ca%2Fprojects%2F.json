For more complete information, the reader is requested to access our  Legal  page. \n Important Caution regarding the Feasibility Study  \n The results of the feasibility study completed on the Company’s project are forward-looking information that are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented here and in the study. The results of the economic analysis in the study are forward-looking information that is subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented here and in the study. \n Important Caution regarding Preliminary Economic Assessments  \n The Preliminary Economic Assessments completed on the Company’s projects are preliminary in nature. They incorporate inferred mineral resources that are considered too geologically speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. These should not be considered prefeasibility or feasibility studies. In addition, mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The results in these reports are forward-looking information that are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented here and in those studies. \n Important Caution regarding Mineral Resources  \n Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have a demonstrated economic viability. The mineral resource estimates discussed may be affected by subsequent assessments of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, socio-economic, legal, political and other factors. There is insufficient information available to assess the extent to which the potential development of the mineral resources described may be affected. \n CONTACT US \n\t\t\t \r\nEmail:  \r\ncontact@centuryglobal.ca \r\n \n\t\t \n \n STAY CONNECTED \n \n Subscribe \n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n 7ads6x98y", "markdown_content": ""}
