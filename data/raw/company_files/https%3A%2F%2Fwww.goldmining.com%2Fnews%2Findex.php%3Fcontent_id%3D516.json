Wainwright & Co., LLC, Haywood Securities Inc., Laurentian Bank Securities Inc. and Roth Capital Partners, LLC (together with the Lead Agents, the \" Agents \"), for a new at-the-market equity program (the \" ATM Program \"), which replaces the Company’s previous at-the-market equity program which is set to expire on January 1, 2023 in accordance with its terms. \r\n\r\n The ATM Program allows the Company to distribute up to US$50 million (or the equivalent in Canadian dollars) of common shares of the Company (the \" Offered Shares \") to the public from time to time, through the Agents, at the Company's discretion. Any Offered Shares sold under the ATM Program will be sold at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. \r\n\r\n The Company intends to use the net proceeds of any sales under the ATM Program to fund the exploration and development of its mineral properties, to fund future acquisitions as may be determined by the Company, and for working capital. \r\n\r\n Under the Distribution Agreement, sales of Offered Shares will be made by the Agents through \"at-the-market distributions\" as defined in National Instrument 44-102 –  Shelf Distributions  on the Toronto Stock Exchange, NYSE American LLC or any other trading market for the Offered Shares in Canada or the United States. The Company is not obligated to make any sales of Offered Shares under the Distribution Agreement. Unless earlier terminated by the Company or the Agents as permitted therein, the Distribution Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of: (a) the date that the aggregate gross sales proceeds of the Offered Shares sold under the ATM Program reaches the aggregate amount of US$50 million (or the equivalent in Canadian dollars); or (b) November 27, 2023. \r\n\r\n The ATM Program will become effective upon the filing of a prospectus supplement to the Company's short form base shelf prospectus dated October 27, 2021 and U.S. registration statement on Form F-10 filed May 3, 2021, as amended on October 27, 2021.

Forward-looking statements are based on the then-current expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates and forecasts about the business and the markets in which GoldMining operates. Forward-looking information includes statements that address or discuss activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates may occur in the future.  When used in this news release, words such as “estimates”, “expects”, “plans”, “anticipates”, “will”, “believes”, “intends” “should”, “could”, “may” and other similar terminology are intended to identify such forward-looking information.   These statements involve significant uncertainties, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors and, therefore, actual results, performance or achievements of the Company and its industry may be materially different from those implied by such forward-looking statements.  Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including: risks that the Company may not sell any of the Offered Shares or may raise less than the maximum offering amount under the ATM Program; management has broad discretion in the use of proceeds from the ATM Program; delays to project plans caused by governmental restrictions and other future impacts or any other inability of the Company to meet expected timelines for planned project activities, including the timing of proposed project studies and programs; the inherent risks involved in the exploration and development of mineral properties, fluctuating metal prices, proposed studies may not confirm GoldMining's expectations for its projects, unanticipated costs and expenses, risks related to government and environmental regulation, social, permitting and licensing matters, and uncertainties relating to the availability and costs of financing needed in the future, including the availability of future borrowings under existing credit facilities. These risks, as well as others, including those set forth in GoldMining ꞌ s Annual Information Form for the year ended November 30, 2021, and other filings with Canadian securities regulators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results and events to vary significantly. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and information. There can be no assurance that forward-looking information, or the material factors or assumptions used to develop such forward-looking information, will prove to be accurate. The Company does not undertake any obligations to release publicly any revisions for updating any voluntary forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities law. \r\n \n    \n\n           \n     \n       \n       \n         Stock Price \n         \n           \n             GOLD: TSX \n             $1.20 \n             $0.01 \n           \n           \n             GOLD (SPOT) \n             $3028.16 \n             $0.00 \n           \n           \n            GLDG:  NYSE AMERICAN \n           $0.838 \n           $0.02 \n           \n         \n         Pricing delayed 20 minutes \n         Investors \n       \n       \n         Corporate Presentation \n         \n       \n     \n   \n   \n     \n       Subscribe to our GoldMining Investment Newsletter \n       \n     \n     \n       \n       \n     \n   \n \n   \n     \n     \n       \n         \n         \n           I agree to and consent to receive news, updates, and other communications by way of commercial electronic messages (including email) from GoldMining Inc.
