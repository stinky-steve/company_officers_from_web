The Technical Report includes separate analyses of both the potash and magnesium development opportunities (all figures in Canadian $): \n Potash Project (Bankable Feasibility Study) \n 100% of production is 97% granular potash (KCL97 TM ) Phase one annual production of 625,000 tonnes, and all three phases 2.125 million tonnes. \n \n NPV (8% ) $3.39 Billion for all 3 phases (after tax) \n IRR 19.1% for 3 Phases, 2.125 million tpy project (after tax) \n CAPEX for Phase 1 $789 Million ($2.396 Billion for all 3 phases) \n OPEX for Phase 1 $136.99 per tonne ($131.70 for all 3 phases) \n Cost per installed tonne of Capacity $1,262 for Phase 1 ($1127 for all 3 phases) \n Proven & Probable Reserves of 147 million tonnes KCl \n Estimated Mine Life over 70 years for 3 Phases, 2.125 million tpy project \n \n \n The discounted cash flow model to determine Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the 2.125 million tpy Potash Project assume a commencement date for production in 2019 and a potash price of $466 (Canadian) per tonne based on a consensus price of potash market analysts with a 3% annual price increase. \n Magnesium Project (Preliminary Feasibility Study) \n Considers annual production of 100,000 tonnes of MgCl 2  brine and 104,000 tonnes of 99+% Hydromagnesite (BMC). Construction assumed after phase 1 of potash) \n \n NPV (10%) $512 Million (after tax) \n IRR 26.1% (after tax) \n CAPEX (additional to Phase 1) $171 million \n OPEX for MgCl 2  Brine $7.01 per tonne \n OPEX for Hydromagnesite $302.01 per tonne \n Probable Reserves for MgCl 2  694.6 million tonnes of carnallitite @ 22.1% MgCl 2 , equivalent to 153.3 million tonnes “mineable” and 7.9 million tonnes of product \n \n \n The discounted cash flow model to determine Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the Magnesium Project was determined based on prices of: $40 per tonne for MgCl 2  brine, $600 per tonne for 50% of the Hydromagnesite as replacement for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate, and the remaining Hydromagnesite at $1800 per tonne as replacement for TiO 2  in paint pigments. \n In assessing the values of these projects the following key figures were determined using a discounted cash flow model: \n \n net present value (NPV): The NPV compares the present value of all cash inflows with the present value of all cash outflows. A positive NPV indicates that a project is expected to give a return in excess of the cost of capital; and \n internal rate of return (IRR): The IRR is the cost of capital or required rate of return which when used to discount the cash flows of a project produces a zero NPV. \n \n The discounted cash flow model, including the metrics and methodology thereof (the “Model”) may not be directly comparable to Models used by other issuers.
