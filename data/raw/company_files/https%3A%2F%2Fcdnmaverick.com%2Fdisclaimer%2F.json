Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with capital expenditures, costs, timing and the success of exploration activities, permitting time lines, requirements for additional capital, government regulation of exploration and/or  mining activities.. Generally, these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved” or the negative connotations thereof. All such forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of the relevant management as of the date such statements are made and are subject to important risk factors and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict. \n\n\n\n Forward-looking statements are necessarily based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: risks and uncertainties relating to, among other things, changes in commodity prices, currency fluctuation, financing, results of exploration activities, cost overruns, availability of materials and equipment, timeliness of government approvals, taxation, political risk and related economic risk and unanticipated environmental impact on operations as well as other risks and uncertainties. \n\n\n\n Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that would cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated, or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. All the forward-looking statements contained on this website are qualified by these cautionary statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management’s current expectations and plans and allowing investors and others to get a better understanding of the Company’s operating environment. The Company expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether because of new information, events or otherwise, except in accordance with applicable securities laws. \n\n\n\n In addition, forward-looking information is based on various assumptions including, without limitation, the expectations and beliefs of management; assumed prices of copper, nickel, zinc and other metals; that the Company can access financing, appropriate equipment and sufficient labour; and that the political environment where the Company operates will continue to support the development and operation of mining projects. Should one or more of these risks and uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that forward-looking information will prove to be accurate, and readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise forward‐looking statements or to explain any material difference between such and subsequent actual events, except as required by applicable law. \n\n\n\n DISCLOSURE OF MINERAL RESERVES AND/OR MINERAL RESOURCES \n\n\n\n Information concerning the properties and operations of CDN Maverick Capital Corp. has been prepared in accordance with Canadian standards under applicable Canadian securities laws, National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) of the Canadian Securities Administrators requires that each category of mineral reserves and mineral resources be reported separately. You should refer to the Company’s continuous disclosure documents filed and available under the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com, for more detailed information, which is subject to the qualifications and notes set forth therein. \n\n\n\n The information contained on this website has been reviewed and approved by XXXX name, title of the Company and a Qualified Person pursuant to NI 43-101. \n\n\n\n CAUTIONARY NOTE TO U.S. INVESTORS \n\n\n\n For United States reporting purposes, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) applies different standards to classify mineralization as a reserve. While the terms “proven mineral reserves”, “probable mineral reserves”, “measured mineral resources”, “indicated mineral resources” and “inferred mineral resources” are accepted pursuant to NI 43-101, the SEC does not recognize such terms. Canadian standards differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC. You are cautioned not to assume that any part or all the mineral resources in these categories constitute or will ever be converted into reserves. In particular, the confidence in inferred mineral resources is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability. Accordingly, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities laws, issuers must not make any disclosure of the results of an economic analysis that includes or is based upon Inferred Mineral Resources, except in rare cases. \n\n\n\n WEBSITE PROVIDED AS A SERVICE ONLY \n\n\n\n This website is not intended as a solicitation or offering of securities in any jurisdiction and the information contained herein in no way should be construed or interpreted as such.
