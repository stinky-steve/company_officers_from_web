                     THIS NEWS RELEASE IS INTENDED FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CANADA ONLY AND IS NOT AUTHORIZED FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 
 Montreal, Quebec, January  13 , 2023 - Aya Gold & Silver Inc.  (TSX: AYA; OTCQX: AYASF) (â Aya â or the â Corporation â) announces that it has obtained a receipt for a final short form base shelf prospectus further to its filing of a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus. Both documents have been filed with the securities regulators in each of the provinces of Canada (excluding the territories). 
 These filings will allow the Corporation, if it chooses, to make offerings of common shares, debt securities, warrants, subscription receipts, or any combination thereof (collectively, the â Securities â), of up to $200 million during the next 25 months in Canada. The Corporation filed this base shelf prospectus to maintain financial flexibility. The net proceeds from any such offerings may be used by the Corporation to advance its business objectives and for general corporate purposes, including funding ongoing operations and/or working capital requirements including among other things, the Zgounder expansion project. 
 This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these Securities in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The Securities will not be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly within the United States (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to transactions exempt from registration under the U.S. Securities Act and under the securities laws of any applicable state. There is no certainty that any Securities will be offered or sold under the prospectus within the 25-month period. 
 In connection with the filing of the aforementioned base shelf, the Corporation refiled its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for the sole and only purpose of inclusion in the financial statements of the auditorsâ report of Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton LLP, the former auditors of the Corporation, for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a view to ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements associated with the Corporationâs filing of its final base shelf prospectus. 
 Copies of the preliminary short form base shelf prospectus and final short form base shelf prospectus can be found on the Corporationâs profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

 Montreal, Quebec, January  13 , 2023 - Aya Gold & Silver Inc.  (TSX: AYA; OTCQX: AYASF) (â Aya â or the â Corporation â) announces that it has obtained a receipt for a final short form base shelf prospectus further to its filing of a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus. Both documents have been filed with the securities regulators in each of the provinces of Canada (excluding the territories). 
 These filings will allow the Corporation, if it chooses, to make offerings of common shares, debt securities, warrants, subscription receipts, or any combination thereof (collectively, the â Securities â), of up to $200 million during the next 25 months in Canada. The Corporation filed this base shelf prospectus to maintain financial flexibility. The net proceeds from any such offerings may be used by the Corporation to advance its business objectives and for general corporate purposes, including funding ongoing operations and/or working capital requirements including among other things, the Zgounder expansion project. 
 This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these Securities in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. The Securities will not be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly within the United States (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) except pursuant to transactions exempt from registration under the U.S. Securities Act and under the securities laws of any applicable state. There is no certainty that any Securities will be offered or sold under the prospectus within the 25-month period. 
 In connection with the filing of the aforementioned base shelf, the Corporation refiled its consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for the sole and only purpose of inclusion in the financial statements of the auditorsâ report of Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton LLP, the former auditors of the Corporation, for the year ended December 31, 2020, with a view to ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements associated with the Corporationâs filing of its final base shelf prospectus. 
 Copies of the preliminary short form base shelf prospectus and final short form base shelf prospectus can be found on the Corporationâs profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
