 Blainville, QuÃ©bec- October 1, 2015 â Maya Gold & Silver Inc. (âMayaâ or the âCorporationâ) (TSXV: MYA)Â  is pleased to announce additional results from the 2015 diamond drill program at its Zgounder Silver Mine in Morocco. Â Overall, the drill program has successfully extended high-grade silver mineralization to the east and to depth for both the parallel Main and North Zones. Â Maya is pleased to provide available results of the following six (6) holes: ZG-Test-01, ZG-Test-13, P-ZG-15-01, ZG-EXT-020, ZG-EXT-023 & ZG-EXT-25. 
 
 The Corporation has completed a 17-hole drill campaign totaling 5,896 meters. With better than expected contractor cost performance, Maya was able to expand the scope of the program to include four addition drill holes from the initial plan. Sulphide mineralization consisting of sphalerite, galena and pyrite was encountered in an altered sandstone unit along with quartz, sericite and chlorite and, in eight holes, native silver mineralization was also observed. To date, 3055 samples have been prepared and assayed at the ALS Laboratory in Spain and all results have been received. Another 1167 samples were shipped to the ALS Laboratory in Ireland with results expected within the next 2 to 3 weeks. Once the final results are validated, Maya will prepare a detailed description of the results and provide the market with an interpretation. 
 Significant results received to date are highlighted below in Table 1.

 Length are core lengths and additional work is required to determine true widths. 
 ** One 0.5m assay interval is above 10Kg/t (value of 10,000 g/t Ag is used) 
 Other metals: Â the analysis of multi-element especially the zinc, lead and copper has provided the identification of at least two important polymetallic corridors with horizontal width of approximately 25 and 40 metres and extending over 1000 metres long in which shoots of higher grade silver mineralization are observed.

 About QA/QC.Â  The initial QA/QC programs includes blanks every 15 samples, standards were inserted every 20 samples and duplicates on pulps every 30 samples. During the process and in an attempt by mine staff to reduce number of samples sent to the laboratory, the mine staff changed the procedure of blanks and standards. Â This has affected the order and frequency of standard Â Â and blank insertions that were not processed within the batch at regular intervals. This has been corrected and the standards and blanks were provided for additional sampling and are within acceptable limits. The results were in line with expected values and allow the disclosure of this press release. The company will carry further verification on this specific sample batch prior to preparation of any mineral resources. The samples are analyzed by 30 grams fire assay with gravimetric finish in addition to multi-elements ICPMS on 41Â elements.

 Blainville, QuÃ©bec- October 1, 2015 â Maya Gold & Silver Inc. (âMayaâ or the âCorporationâ) (TSXV: MYA)Â  is pleased to announce additional results from the 2015 diamond drill program at its Zgounder Silver Mine in Morocco. Â Overall, the drill program has successfully extended high-grade silver mineralization to the east and to depth for both the parallel Main and North Zones. Â Maya is pleased to provide available results of the following six (6) holes: ZG-Test-01, ZG-Test-13, P-ZG-15-01, ZG-EXT-020, ZG-EXT-023 & ZG-EXT-25. 
 
 The Corporation has completed a 17-hole drill campaign totaling 5,896 meters. With better than expected contractor cost performance, Maya was able to expand the scope of the program to include four addition drill holes from the initial plan. Sulphide mineralization consisting of sphalerite, galena and pyrite was encountered in an altered sandstone unit along with quartz, sericite and chlorite and, in eight holes, native silver mineralization was also observed. To date, 3055 samples have been prepared and assayed at the ALS Laboratory in Spain and all results have been received. Another 1167 samples were shipped to the ALS Laboratory in Ireland with results expected within the next 2 to 3 weeks. Once the final results are validated, Maya will prepare a detailed description of the results and provide the market with an interpretation. 
 Significant results received to date are highlighted below in Table 1.

 Length are core lengths and additional work is required to determine true widths. 
 ** One 0.5m assay interval is above 10Kg/t (value of 10,000 g/t Ag is used) 
 Other metals: Â the analysis of multi-element especially the zinc, lead and copper has provided the identification of at least two important polymetallic corridors with horizontal width of approximately 25 and 40 metres and extending over 1000 metres long in which shoots of higher grade silver mineralization are observed.

 About QA/QC.Â  The initial QA/QC programs includes blanks every 15 samples, standards were inserted every 20 samples and duplicates on pulps every 30 samples. During the process and in an attempt by mine staff to reduce number of samples sent to the laboratory, the mine staff changed the procedure of blanks and standards. Â This has affected the order and frequency of standard Â Â and blank insertions that were not processed within the batch at regular intervals. This has been corrected and the standards and blanks were provided for additional sampling and are within acceptable limits. The results were in line with expected values and allow the disclosure of this press release. The company will carry further verification on this specific sample batch prior to preparation of any mineral resources. The samples are analyzed by 30 grams fire assay with gravimetric finish in addition to multi-elements ICPMS on 41Â elements.
