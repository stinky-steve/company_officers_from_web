                                         Imiter bis, formerly known as 233263 Permit, is an exploration property located on Moroccoâs sub-Atlas range, about 150 kilometers from Ouarzazate and just five kilometers south of the world-class Imiter Mine. The geology and Phase I drill results indicate the presence of a 4-km potential at-surface polymetallic structure hosted within a low-sulphidation epithermal system

  Imiter bis is underlain by a complex bi-modal volcanic sequence of the Ourzazate Supergroup overlying the Precambrian pelitic sequence of the Anti-Atlas Supergroup that hosts the Imiter silver deposit. The host bi-modal volcanic sequence consists of flow-banded rhyolite, felsic volcanic conglomerates, porphyritic dacite and andesite, and basalt. The host sequence is intruded by multiple syn-volcanic granitic and granodioritic intrusions and mafic dykes.

 The property is cut by two major structures filled by low-sulphidation epithermal vein systems, oriented in a N-S and NE-SW orientation, associated with the regional fault system. Additionally, multiple syn-to-late-volcanic faults cut the sequence, many of which are mineralized.

  The Imiter bis property is strongly endowed with Au-Ag-Cu-Pb and Zn mineralization at surface associated with several orientations of quartz veins, hydrothermal breccias and syn-to-late volcanic faults. The bulk of the precious and base-metal mineralization observed is associated with two major epithermal vein systems that range from 1.5 meters to 2.0 meters in thickness and locally reaches 10m wide, spanning the length of the permit in a N-S and NE-SW orientation. Epithermal vein textures observed at surface mainly consist of massive, bladed, brecciated, comb textures and chalcedonic quartz. The main sulphide minerals observed in these veins consist of minor blebs of chalcopyrite, malachite, and galena along with massive hematite filling box-work and fractures.

  Additionally, copper-rich zones have been identified at surface in the eastern portion of the property associated with several parallel NW-trending late-volcanic faults, cutting a granodioritic intrusion. These faults are filled with malachite, azurite (see figure left), and minor fresh chalcopyrite.

                                         Imiter bis, formerly known as 233263 Permit, is an exploration property located on Moroccoâs sub-Atlas range, about 150 kilometers from Ouarzazate and just five kilometers south of the world-class Imiter Mine. The geology and Phase I drill results indicate the presence of a 4-km potential at-surface polymetallic structure hosted within a low-sulphidation epithermal system

  Imiter bis is underlain by a complex bi-modal volcanic sequence of the Ourzazate Supergroup overlying the Precambrian pelitic sequence of the Anti-Atlas Supergroup that hosts the Imiter silver deposit. The host bi-modal volcanic sequence consists of flow-banded rhyolite, felsic volcanic conglomerates, porphyritic dacite and andesite, and basalt. The host sequence is intruded by multiple syn-volcanic granitic and granodioritic intrusions and mafic dykes.

 The property is cut by two major structures filled by low-sulphidation epithermal vein systems, oriented in a N-S and NE-SW orientation, associated with the regional fault system. Additionally, multiple syn-to-late-volcanic faults cut the sequence, many of which are mineralized.

  The Imiter bis property is strongly endowed with Au-Ag-Cu-Pb and Zn mineralization at surface associated with several orientations of quartz veins, hydrothermal breccias and syn-to-late volcanic faults. The bulk of the precious and base-metal mineralization observed is associated with two major epithermal vein systems that range from 1.5 meters to 2.0 meters in thickness and locally reaches 10m wide, spanning the length of the permit in a N-S and NE-SW orientation. Epithermal vein textures observed at surface mainly consist of massive, bladed, brecciated, comb textures and chalcedonic quartz. The main sulphide minerals observed in these veins consist of minor blebs of chalcopyrite, malachite, and galena along with massive hematite filling box-work and fractures.

  Additionally, copper-rich zones have been identified at surface in the eastern portion of the property associated with several parallel NW-trending late-volcanic faults, cutting a granodioritic intrusion. These faults are filled with malachite, azurite (see figure left), and minor fresh chalcopyrite.
