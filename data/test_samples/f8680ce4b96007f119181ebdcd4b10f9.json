Karnalyte intends to construct a 2.125 million tonnes per year potash solution mining facility using a three phase modular approach. The first phase is 625,000 tonnes per year followed by two 750,000 tonne expansions. Karnalyte will produce a premium granular potash product with minimal environmental impact. Karnalyte has obtained a bankable feasibility study, EIS approval, magnesium co-product preliminary feasibility study, and recently updated its 43-101 compliant technical report. \n Vision & Strategy \n Karnalyte intends to maximize shareholder and stakeholder value with the financing and construction of the Wynyard Project. Karnalyte Resources’ vision is to become a low-cost producer of high quality, low sodium granular potash. To move forward Karnalyte has partnered with GSFC, a major Indian agribusiness company. \n Strategic Partnership \n Karnalyte Resources Inc. has a strategic partnership with Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals, one of India’s largest fertilizer and industrial chemicals manufacturing companies. GSFC holds a 47.73% ownership stake in Karnalyte. \n In connection with this partnership, Karnalyte and GSFC executed an off-take agreement (the “Offtake Agreement) for GSFC’s purchase of approximately 350,000 tpy from Phase 1. The offtake commences with commercial production from Phase 1 with the result that Karnalyte has secured sales for approximately 56% of its potash production from Phase 1 for approximately 20 years. \n The Agreement also provides GSFC with the option to increase its off-take to 600,000 tpy when Phase 2 goes into commercial production, and potentially up to 1,000,000 tpy when Phase 3 is completed. \n The strategic partnership between Karnalyte and GSFC provides Karnalyte with a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace, and is anticipated to provide GSFC with a secure supply of potash for many years to come. \n     \n  \n\n \n\n           \n      \n     \n\n    \n\n   \n\n\n\n  \n\n   \n\n\n  \n     \n\n  \n\n    \n       \n\n    \n     \n       \n         \n\n           \n         \n       \n     \n\n     \n       Toggle the Widgetbar      \n\n    \n  ", "markdown_content": ""}
