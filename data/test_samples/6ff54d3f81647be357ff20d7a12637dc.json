The court hearing for the final order to approve the Arrangement is scheduled to take place on February 7, 2022. If completed, the Arrangement will result in, among other things, CUR transferring ownership of its Moran Lake project to LUR in exchange for 16,000,000 common shares of LUR (“LUR Common Shares”), which LUR Common Shares will be distributed to CUR Shareholders on a pro-rata basis pursuant to the provisions of the plan of arrangement. \r\n \r\nCUR shareholders must hold their CUR Common Shares until 12:01 am on the effective date of the Arrangement (the “Effective Date”) in order to receive their pro rata portion of the LUR Common Shares being distributed pursuant to the Arrangement. CUR will disseminate a press release to notify shareholders five business days in advance of the Effective Date once all of the conditions to closing of the Arrangement have been satisfied in accordance with the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”). \r\n \r\nLUR has applied to list the LUR Common Shares on the on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) following completion of the Arrangement. Listing is subject to the approval of the CSE in accordance with its original listing requirements. Completion of the Arrangement and listing of the LUR Common Shares on the CSE is expected to be completed by the end of February 2022. \r\n \r\n About Consolidated Uranium Inc. \r\nConsolidated Uranium Inc. (TSXV: CUR) (OTCQB: CURUF) was created in early 2020 to capitalize on an anticipated uranium market resurgence using the proven model of diversified project consolidation. To date, the Company has acquired or has the right to acquire uranium projects in Australia, Canada, Argentina, and the United States each with significant past expenditures and attractive characteristics for development. Most recently, the Company completed a transformational strategic acquisition and alliance with Energy Fuels Inc (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), a leading U.S.-based uranium mining company, and acquired a portfolio of permitted, past-producing conventional uranium and vanadium mines in Utah and Colorado. These mines are currently on stand-by, ready for rapid restart as market conditions permit, positioning CUR as a near-term uranium producer. \r\n  \r\n\r\n For More Information, Please Contact \r\n \r\n Philip Williams \r\nChairman and CEO \r\n pwilliams@consolidateduranium.com \r\n \r\n Mars Investor Relations \r\n+1 647 557 6640 \r\n cur@marsinvestorrelations.com \r\n \r\nTwitter:  @ConsolidatedUr \r\n www.consolidateduranium.com \r\n \r\nNeither the TSXV nor its Regulations Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. \r\n \r\n Cautionary Statement Regarding “Forward-Looking” Information \r\n \r\n This news release contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. “Forward-looking information” includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the completion of the Arrangement; anticipated timing for completion of the Arrangement and listing of the LUR Common Shares; and other activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future.

Although the assumptions made by the Company in providing forward-looking information or making forward-looking statements are considered reasonable by management at the time, there can be no assurance that such assumptions will prove to be accurate. Forward-looking information and statements also involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual events or results in future periods to differ materially from any projections of future events or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking information or statements, including, among others: the diversion of management time on transaction-related issues; expectations regarding negative operating cash flow and dependence on third party financing, uncertainty of additional financing, no known mineral reserves or resources, reliance on key management and other personnel, potential downturns in economic conditions, actual results of exploration activities being different than anticipated, changes in exploration programs based upon results, risks generally associated with the mineral exploration industry, environmental risks, changes in laws and regulations, community relations, delays in obtaining governmental or other approvals and the risk factors set out in the Company’s annual information form in respect of the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Canadian securities regulators and available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
