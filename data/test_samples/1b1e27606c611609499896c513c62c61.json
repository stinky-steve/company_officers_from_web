(“Panther Minerals” or the “Company”) (CSE:PURR) (OTC:GLIOF) (FWB:2BC)  is pleased to announce that Lindsay Bottomer has joined the Company’s advisory board. Lindsay has over 45 years of experience in international exploration and development, most recently focused on epithermal gold and porphyry copper-gold exploration in the American Cordillera and Central Asia. Lindsay has been a former officer or director of more than 20 public companies, including Entree Resources and Richfield Ventures. While with Entree he was closely involved in the discovery and definition drilling of both the Hugo North Extended and Heruga Cu-Au porphyry systems in the Oyu Tolgoi camp of Mongolia, and acquisition of the Ann Mason Cu porphyry deposit in Nevada. He was a founding director of Richfield Ventures which acquired and advanced the Blackwater gold deposit in BC prior to its sale to New Gold for approx. $500 million. \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n Panther Minerals is also excited to provide information on the “ Fireweed Prospect, ” a uranium discovery made by Triex Minerals Inc., in 2006, located approximately 28 km northwest of the Boulder Creek Uranium deposit. The Fireweed mineralization was discovered in outcrop through the investigation of a strong radiometric anomaly detected by Triex’s regional exploration program. The anomaly was visited in 2006, and four samples taken, with sample #95812 returning 0.82% U3O8 (6,950 ppm U) from “granitic, stained brick red by pervasive hematite, with specks of black mineral, likely pitchblende, forming about 2% of the sample” (Triex Internal Company Report – 2006 Report on Boulder Creek Property). \n \n \n\n\n\n In 2007 Triex returned to the Fireweed Showing and completed 22 line-km of ground magnetic susceptibility and radiometric surveying, rock and soil sampling survey and prospecting. As reported in Triex First Quarter of Fiscal 2008 (Three Months Ended October 31, 2007): “Twenty-one (21 ) rock samples collected from three main areas along the contact contain from 0.14% to 0.81% U308. These data confirm the 0.82% U308 value obtained from the single sample collected during a brief site visit in 2006. More than 300 sub-angular radioactive pebbles of silica-hematite rock have been identified from 130 mapped sites which cover an area of approximately 1,800 metres long east-west by 700 metres wide north-south…… A quick, first-pass drill test was done at Fireweed in September, … Five short drill holes were completed for a total of 267 metres. Overburden in four of five holes was only 1.5 metres thick. Quartz syenite is predominant and in all five holes there is lesser feldspar that locally reads 2 – 3 times background radioactivity. Brick red hematite-silica zones similar in appearance to the pebbles mapped on surface were observed in Hole 5 and were five times background radioactivity.” \n\n\n\n Based on the data reviewed to date, and as indicated in the Triex reports, the size and strength of the anomalies (airborne radiometric, ground radiometric, rock sampling, and soil geochemistry) at the Fireweed Prospect are much larger and stronger, than at the Boulder Creek deposit. The values from one season of sampling are very encouraging and represents another priority target for the Company. In addition, although at an early exploration stage, the Fireweed mineralization differs substantially from that at the Boulder Creek deposit.  \n\n\n\n “We are excited to provide additional information relating to the Fireweed prospect on our Boulder Creek project” stated Rob Birmingham, President of Panther Minerals. “Through our recent property expansion, adding in this portion of the project was crucial, as the previous discovery of mineralization offers a significant opportunity to add value to Panther.”  \n\n\n\n Pinnacle Digest Agreement:  \n\n\n\n Panther Minerals Inc. has entered a content creation and online marketing service agreement dated May 30, 2024 (the “Pinnacle Digest Agreement”) with Maximus Strategic Consulting Inc.

First explored by Houston Oil & Minerals between 1978 and 1981, completing 52 core holes (3,463 m) and about 60 m of near-surface split-tube sampling in 21 holes, Boulder Creek has a historic resource estimate (non-National Instrument 43-101 compliant) of one million pounds U308 at an average grade of 0.27 per cent and average thickness of three metres and depth of mineralization from surface to 120 metres. \n\n\n\n The foregoing is a historical estimate made prior to the implementation of National Instrument 43-101 — Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and was not prepared in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101, nor does it use the categories of mineral resources set forth in NI 43-101; however, with the limited information available to the company at this time, it is not able to provide an explanation of the differences. While the company considers the historic estimate to provide information as to the historical exploration on the property, a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and the company is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The historical estimate should not be relied upon. \n\n\n\n The project was most recently explored by Triex Mineral Corp. between 2006 and 2008. Triex conducted soil and bio-geochemical surveys on the prospect, along with surface prospecting and airborne radiometric surveys and completed 22 core holes (2,217 m). \n\n\n\n Some of the exploration information presented herein includes historical data developed by previous operators of the property. The company is providing these historical data for informational purposes only and gives no assurance as to their reliability and relevance to the company’s proposed exploration program at the property. A qualified person has not verified the historical data. The company has not completed any quality assurance program or applied quality control measures to the historical data. Accordingly, the historical data should not be relied upon. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. \n\n\n\n Qualified Person \n\n\n\n The scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved for disclosure by Lindsay Bottomer, PGeo. Mr. Bottomer is a qualified person within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 — Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects and is a consultant for the company. \n\n\n\n About Panther Minerals Inc. \n\n\n\n Panther Minerals is a mineral exploration company actively involved in the exploration of its North American project portfolio. The acquisition of the Boulder Creek option reflects the company’s continuing intention of pursuing advanced, high-quality prospective uranium projects that can be readily worked on and efficiently explored in a timely manner. \n\n\n\n ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS \n\n\n\n Mr. Robert Birmingham, Chief Executive Officer For more information please visit:  www.pantherminerals.ca  or email info@pantherminerals.ca. \n\n\n\n The CSE and Information Service Provider have not reviewed and does not accept responsibility for the accuracy or adequacy of this release. \n\n\n\n Forward-Looking Statements \n\n\n\n This news release contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.
