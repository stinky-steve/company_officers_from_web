Mr. Beck holds an MBA from the Ivey Business School, University of Western Ontario, and a BSc (engineering physics) from Queen’s University.  \n\n\n\n “Our accomplishments as Lithium Lion Metals Inc. have laid a strong foundation, and we are confident that this evolution to Panther Minerals Inc. will reinforce our promise of value creation for shareholders,” remarked David Beck, Chief Executive Officer. “We eagerly anticipate the prospects that Panther Minerals Inc. brings forth, as we strive to foster a more sustainable and prosperous energy metals landscape. “Furthermore, the Company announces that Mr. Steven Inglefield has resigned as Chief Financial Officer and Corporate Secretary.

Often, but not always, forward-looking information and information can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “estimates”, “intends”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Actual future results may differ materially. In particular, this release contains forward-looking information relating to the Name and Symbol Change, and the prospects of the Company and the mineral exploration industry generally. The forward-looking information reflects management’s current expectations based on information currently available and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking information. Such risk factors may include, among others, but are not limited to: general economic conditions in Canada and globally; industry conditions, including governmental regulation and environmental regulation; the availability of capital on acceptable terms; the need to obtain required approvals from regulatory authorities; stock market volatility; competition for, among other things, skilled personnel and supplies; incorrect assessments of the value of acquisitions; geological, technical, processing and transportation problems; changes in tax laws and incentive programs; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and dispositions; and the other factors. Although the Company believes that the assumptions and factors used in preparing the forward-looking information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on such information and no assurance can be given that such events will occur in the disclosed time frames or at all. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include: (i) adverse market conditions; and (ii) other factors beyond the control of the Company. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is impossible for the Company’s management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on Company’s business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking information. The forward-looking information included in this news release are made as of the date of this news release and the Company expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Additional information identifying risks and uncertainties that could affect financial results is contained in the Company’s filings with Canadian securities regulators, which are available on SEDAR+ at  www.sedarplus.ca . \n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t Recent News​​ \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t PANTHER MINERALS ANNOUNCES DIRECTOR RESIGNATION \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Feb 28, 2025 Vancouver, British Columbia - TheNewswire – February 28th, 2025- Panther Minerals Inc.
