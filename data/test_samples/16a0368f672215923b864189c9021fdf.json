(\"  CUR  \" or the \"  Company  \") (TSXV: CUR) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement (the \"  Termination Agreement  \") with Meliadine Gold Ltd. (  \"MGL\"  ) to terminate the existing amended and restated earn-in agreement (the  \"Earn-In Agreement\"  ) dated February 2, 2017 between the Company and MGL relating to the Kuulu Gold Project in Nunavut. \r\n\r\n The key terms of the Termination Agreement are: \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Termination Payment  - CUR is entitled to receive a termination payment from MGL, payable through the issuance of 2,000,000 shares of MGL \r\n\t Private Placement  - CUR has agreed to purchase 1,500,000 units of MGL (\"  Units  \") at a price of $0.10 per Unit for aggregate consideration of $150,000 . Each Unit is comprised of one common share and one half warrant exercisable at $0.10 per share for a period of one year from closing subject to acceleration in the event that MGL receives a land use permit \r\n\t Equity Participation Right  - CUR has been granted a right to participate in future equity financings of MGL in order to maintain its pro rata equity position in MGL for so long as CUR holds at least 10% of MGL's issued and outstanding shares \r\n\t Board Nomination Right  - CUR has been granted the right to nominate one director to the board of directors of MGL for so long as CUR holds at least 10% of MGL's issued and outstanding shares \r\n\t Right of First Offer  - CUR has been granted an exclusive right of first offer (  \"ROFO\"  ) in respect of any joint venture or earn-in agreement for the Kuulu Project \r\n \r\n\r\n Philip Williams , President and CEO commented, \"We are very pleased to have entered into this agreement with Meliadine Gold Ltd. which we believe is a good outcome for both groups but more importantly positions the Kuulu Project for future advancement. The Earn-In Agreement was the cornerstone for NxGold Ltd., the former name of the Company, however, due to continued delays in the renewal of the existing land use agreement the Earn-In Agreement was put into force majore thereby preventing the Company from earning its potential interest in the Kuluu Project. The Termination Agreement gives CUR the ability to secure up to a 20% equity interest in MGL with important rights to maintain this interest and oversee the future progress of the Kuluu Project. The MGL team has a long history with the project and area and we are optimistic they can make progress on the land use renewal permit in due course.\" \r\n\r\n Glen Dickson , President and CEO of Meliadine Gold Ltd commented, \"I am pleased to welcome International Consolidated Uranium as a shareholder of Meliadine Gold. Both groups recognize the potential of the project but also that the path forward requires a patient and focused approach which the team at MGL is well equipped to undertake.\" \r\n\r\n About International Consolidated Uranium \r\n\r\n International Consolidated Uranium Inc.
