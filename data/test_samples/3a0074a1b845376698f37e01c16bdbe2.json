ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENT OF CFO AND GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS \n Not for distribution to U.S. news wire services or dissemination in the United States. \n SASKATOON, SK (CNW–December 15, 2017)  – Karnalyte Resources Inc. (“ Karnalyte ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX: KRN) is pleased to announce the appointment of Ms. Danielle Favreau as Chief Financial Officer. The Company also announces the grants of stock options. \n Karnalyte’s interim CEO Todd Rowan commented “The Board and management wish to thank shareholders for their continued support as we strive to develop a strong base for the creation of shareholder value. The appointment of Ms. Favreau represents an important step in the creation of a strong and stable management team at Karnalyte. In addition to the appointment of Ms. Favreau, the Board continues to work with a professional firm in search of a Chief Executive Officer. We are confident that this process will culminate in a strong leadership team to take Karnalyte forward. In addition to building the team, Karnalyte has been working diligently to optimize the capital and operating costs of the Wynyard Carnallite Project. Our goals remain steadfast and although potash fundamentals have changed in recent years, we along with our strategic partner, Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd., are working extremely hard to develop the Wynyard Carnallite Project.” \n Ms. Favreau has been with Karnalyte since the fall of 2015 first joining as the Company’s Controller and later appointed as the Company’s Interim Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining Karnalyte, Danielle served in senior roles in both audit and human resources at Virtus Group LLP, the largest independently owned accounting firm in Saskatchewan. She also served as Controller at Great Western Minerals Group and served many mining clients with Deloitte in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Ms. Favreau attended the University of Saskatchewan where she obtained her Bachelor of Commerce Degree. She also obtained her CPA, CA designation through CPA Saskatchewan (formerly the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Saskatchewan). Ms. Favreau volunteers extensively in the Saskatoon community. She recently served as a director of the Mendel Art Gallery and Remai Modern Art Gallery of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon serving on the audit and finance committees of both organizations. She is currently serving as a director on the board of the Saskatoon Community Foundation and also serves on this organization’s audit and finance committee.   \n The Company also announces that, pursuant to the Company’s stock option plan, Karnalyte has granted an aggregate of 730,000 stock options to employees, officers and directors of the Company. The shareholders of the Company approved the stock option plan on June 20, 2013 and later on August 26, 2016 approved all unallocated stock options as required by the Toronto Stock Exchange. The purpose of the stock option plan is to give suitable recognition to the ability and performance of such persons who contribute materially to the success of the Corporation and to attract and retain persons of experience and ability by providing them with the opportunity to acquire an increased proprietary interest in the Corporation. All of the stock options were issued with an exercise price of $0.75 per share, have a 5 year term and vest over a period of 2 years.  \n ABOUT KARNALYTE RESOURCES INC. \n Karnalyte is a Saskatchewan-headquartered company focused on exploration and development of potash and magnesium in Saskatchewan.
