Rather than deep well disposal, a Preliminary Feasibility Study was carried out considering the production of high grade magnesium compounds from a portion of the tailings stream. \n The Preliminary Feasibility Study considered the sale of 100,000 tonnes per year of 32% magnesium chloride brine and 104,000 tonnes per year of 99%+ Hydromagnesite (Basic Magnesium Carbonate, or BMC). \n Magnesium Chloride brine is used primarily for: \n \n highway de-icing in winter months \n gravel road dust control in summer months \n sewage treatment \n textiles and paper \n cement additive \n oil well drilling fluid \n \n Hydromagnesite (BMC) is being considered for use as: \n \n TiO 2  extender for paints, paper, and plastics \n Precipitated Calcium Carbonate replacement for pulp and paper \n Feedstock for the production of high grade magnesium chemicals \n Feedstock for the production of fuel additives \n Mineral fire retardant \n \n Karnalyte - Magnesium Compounds Product Line \n \n  \n\n \n\n           \n      \n     \n\n    \n\n   \n\n\n\n  \n\n   \n\n\n  \n     \n\n  \n\n    \n       \n\n    \n     \n       \n         \n\n           \n         \n       \n     \n\n     \n       Toggle the Widgetbar      \n\n    \n  ", "markdown_content": ""}
