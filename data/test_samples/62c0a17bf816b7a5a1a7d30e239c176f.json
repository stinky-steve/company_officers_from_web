When used in this website, such statements use such words as “may”, “would”, “could”, “will”, “intend”, “expect”, “believe”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “estimate” and other similar terminology. These statements reflect the Corporation’s current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date of this presentation. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether or not such results will be achieved. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward- looking statements, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in the Corporation’s annual information form filed on March 30, 2016.

These include, but are not limited to, the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, including environmental approval, the failure to secure full project financing, the failure to implement the recommendations set out in the Corporation’s technical report entitled KCl and MgCl2 Reserve and Resource Estimate for the Wynyard Carnallite Project, Subsurface Mineral Leases KL 246, KL 247 and KLSA 010, Saskatchewan, Canada (the “Technical Report”) the failure to raise financing to implement the recommendations in the Technical Report, risks associated with the mining industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, reserves and resources, costs and expenses, and health, safety and environmental risks), decrease in commodity prices and exchange rate fluctuations. \n Although the forward-looking statements contained in this website are based upon what management of the Corporation believes are reasonable assumptions, the Corporation cannot assure shareholders that actual results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements.
