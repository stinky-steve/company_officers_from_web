They received exclusive access to notable international speakers and experts who provided unique insights. They delved behind the headlines and beyond the obvious to show how underlying trends and sructural factors will infuence world markets for iron ore in years to come. Attendees have said they particularly valued access to senior Chinese executives who are rarely heard in North America, and the arms-length expertise of the global firm CRU Strategies. Several said they had not previously heard about the opportunities in Canada for Direct Shipping Ore (DSO). \n Century is pleased with these outcomes and will be setting a date for the 2014 edition of the conference very soon.
