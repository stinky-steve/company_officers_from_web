(“ Labrador Uranium ” or “ LUR ”) through a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “ Arrangement ”). LUR has expanded its land holdings in Labrador around its anticipated key projects as well as bolstered its technical team with several key appointments in preparation for an aggressive summer 2022 work program. \r\n \r\nStephen Keith, CEO of LUR, commented “We are very pleased with our progress to date while we plan our 2022 exploration season and prepare to become a public company.  Focusing on governance and strategy, LUR has assembled a strong prospective Board of Directors; and, with a focus on creating the greatest opportunity for exploration success, LUR has been able to attract a great geological brain trust as well as increasing and further consolidated its strategic land holdings in a well-known and significant mineral belt.” \r\n  \r\nPlease click on this  link  to view a video on today’s release from LUR’s CEO Stephen Keith. \r\n  \r\n Current Projects and New Acquisitions \r\n  \r\nLUR’s strategy is to consolidate and aggressively explore its land position in the Central Mineral Belt (“ CMB ”) of Labrador, Canada. In late 2021, LUR entered into several agreements to acquire the following projects: \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Moran Lake Project: To be acquired from Consolidated Uranium. The project hosts historic uranium and vanadium mineral resources. Over $25 million has been spent on the project to date and holds further exploration potential; \r\n\t Central Mineral Belt (CMB) Project: To be acquired from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altius Minerals Corporation (“ Altius ”). This project includes approximately 125,000 hectares of land with more than 50 years of exploration data available.  This project contains many known occurrences of uranium, copper, gold, iron and other elements identified in 140 targets; \r\n\t Notakwanon Project: To be acquired from Altius.  This is a near surface discovery with over 20 uranium occurrences at surface and grab samples yielding up to 3.5% U 3 O 8 ; \r\n\t Mustang Lake joint venture interest (66%): To be acquired from Mega Uranium Ltd. This project is approximately 9.5 kilometers northeast of Paladin Energy’s Michelin uranium deposit. Mustang Lake has seen historic drilling, has multiple uranium occurrences, and is also prospective for IOCG style mineralization. \r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\nLUR has recently added the following 683 claims (17,075 hectares) by staking and, when taken together with the above projects, LUR expects to hold a dominant land position in the CMB and surrounding area at Notakwanon: \r\n\r\n \r\n\t 256 claims (6,400 hectares) located to the west of the Michelin uranium deposit with extension potential; \r\n\t 120 claims (3,000 hectares) located around the Notakwanon Project, consolidating more land around this prospect; \r\n\t 307 claims (7,675 hectares) in four map-staked licenses located to the north of the existing CMB claims covering prospective areas.   \r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n Figure 1: LUR District Scale Claims across Labrador  \r\n \r\n  \r\n Building A Strong Team \r\n  \r\nIn addition to growing its land position, LUR has strengthened its geological team. The new additions, detailed below, will bring particular expertise to analyzing and assessing the vast amount of data available to LUR on its projects in order to generate targets for this coming field season.  \r\n  \r\n Dr. Paul Pearson – Chief Geologist .
