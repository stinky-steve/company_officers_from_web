ANNOUNCES 2018 SECOND QUARTER RESULTS AND PROVIDES UPDATE ON POTASH AND NITROGEN PROJECTS \n Not for distribution to U.S. news wire services or dissemination in the United States. \n SASKATOON, SK (CNW- August 9, 2018) – Karnalyte Resources Inc. (“Karnalyte” or the “Company”) (TSX: KRN) today announced its financial results and operational and corporate highlights for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018, and provided an update on the status of its Wynyard Potash Project and Proteos Nitrogen Project. \n Overview \n Karnalyte has made significant progress in investigating the economic and technical viability of the Proteos Nitrogen Project during the second quarter of 2018.  In addition to issuing an invitation for expressions of interest for the technical and economic aspects of the project, and initiating an independent market analysis, Karnalyte has undertaken due diligence on a number of potential project sites. \n Mr. Frank Wheatley, President of Karnalyte, commented that: “The technical assistance provided by Karnaltye’s strategic partner Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited (GSFC) from their five (5) decades experience in nitrogen fertilizer production has allowed Karnalyte to streamline some of the early phases of development, and we are grateful for their technical and commercial assistance as we continue to explore the Proteos Nitrogen Project.” \n With respect to the Wynyard Potash Project, while there have been some encouraging signs regarding the potash price environment, prices have not yet recovered to the point where the Wynyard Potash Project is economically viable and financeable.  During the second half of 2018, Karnalyte and GSFC intend to revisit the timing and sequence of the steps required to re-activate development of the project. \n Proteos Nitrogen Project \n \nPre-Feasibility Study \n Karnalyte has initiated several component parts of the pre-feasibility study on the Proteos Nitrogen Project, designed to explore the technical and economic viability of the proposed project, including an invitation for expressions of interest on the technical and economic aspects of the project, an independent market analysis, and due diligence on a number of potential project sites. \n \n Expression of Interest \n As previously reported on July 30, 2018, Karnalyte has issued, through its strategic partner GSFC, an invitation for expressions of interest (“EOI”) from a select group of international technology providers and engineering, procurement and construction contractors, for developing the Proteos Nitrogen Project on a lump sum turn-key basis. \n The scope of work covered by the EOI includes all phases of development, from basic engineering, through detailed engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning and satisfaction of all relevant performance and completion tests, including all ancillary facilities and infrastructure, together with an estimate of total capital costs for the project.  Karnalyte / GSFC have requested that all EOIs be provided on or before the end of August, 2018.  After receipt, Karnalyte / GSFC will review the EOIs with a view to developing a short list of technology providers / contractors to receive a formal request for proposal, for EPC arrangements, for development of the Proteos Nitrogen Project. \n\t \n Independent Market Analysis \n Karnalyte has retained Integer Research Ltd. (“Integer Research”) to undertake a first phase independent market study of the nitrogen fertilizer industry in North America, with particular focus on Central Canada.  The purpose of the study is to validate Karnalyte’s internal market analysis, and Karnalyte anticipates receiving the first phase report in September 2018.  Subject to a positive outcome for the Project in the first phase study, Karnalyte intends to retain Integer Research to undertake a second phase study in order to support discussions regarding project financing for the Proteos Nitrogen Project. \n About Integer Research \n Integer Research is an internationally recognized independent consultant to the fertilizers and chemicals industry that provides market studies, including supply/demand, trade and cost analysis and price forecasts.  With respect to nitrogen, they offer capabilities across the nitrogen value chain, including analysis of ammonia, urea, UAN, and other nitrogen products.  They produce market documentation for lenders and banks in support of project financing for greenfield and brownfield fertilizer projects.  Through their offices in London, Beijing, and Tokyo, Integer Research offers consultancy series and industry intelligence to fertilizer and chemicals markets worldwide. \n Feedback from Potential Customers \n As part of Karnalyte’s internal market analysis, it has spoken with a number of potential customers based in Saskatchewan for the two nitrogen fertilizer products it is considering producing, anhydrous ammonia and urea.  Those discussions confirm Karnalyte’s market thesis that there is, as with most industrial materials, both a desire and a demand for an independent, alternate source of supply of nitrogen fertilizer in central Saskatchewan. \n Project Site \n Karnalyte is currently undertaking due diligence on a number of potential project sites located in Central Saskatchewan that match Karnalyte’s project site selection criteria, which include adequate space for the initial development, as well as for potential future expansion, together with proximity to all requisite infrastructure, including natural gas, power, water, rail and highway. \n Milestones: \tIndicative project development milestones include: \n•\tReceipt of EOIs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAugust 2018 \n•\tReceipt of Phase 1 independent market analysis\t\t\t\tSeptember 2018 \n•\tProject Site – selection of preferred site\t\t\t\t\tSecond Half 2018 \n•\tCompletion of Pre-Feasibility Study:\t\t\t\t\tSecond Half 2018 \n As initial milestones are achieved, management will be in a better position to prepare a more detailed project development schedule and budget.  All initial development activities for the first phase of investigation of this opportunity will be funded from working capital. \n Wynyard Potash Project \n While there have been some encouraging signs regarding the potash price environment, potash prices have not yet recovered to the point where the Wynyard Potash Project is economically viable and financeable.  However, given the lead times necessary to prepare a major mining project for construction, and in order to ensure that it is developed in a timely fashion to take advantage of any future increase in potash prices, during the second half of 2018, Karnalyte and GSFC intend to revisit the timing and sequence of the steps required to re-activate development of the project. \n \nOutlook for 2018 \n During the second half of 2018, the Company will continue to ensure that it is in a position to re-activate the development of the Wynyard Potash Project, if the improving potash price environment results in the Wynyard Potash Project becoming economically viable and financeable.  In addition, the Company will continue to explore the technical and economic viability of developing the Proteos Nitrogen Project, with a view towards making an investment decision during the first half of 2019. \n 2018 Second Quarter Results \n At June 30, 2018, the Company had cash of $10.2 million, a positive working capital of $10.3 million and no debt.  The Company has adequate cash to fund any existing commitments in 2018 and through the second quarter of 2019.  Furthermore, the Company has sufficient cash to meet short term operating and capital requirements.
