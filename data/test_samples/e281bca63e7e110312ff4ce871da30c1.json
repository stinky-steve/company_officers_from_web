(“ IsoEnergy ”) ( TSXV: ISO; OTCQX: ISENF ) is pleased to announce the implementation of its senior leadership transition plan with the appointment of Tim Gabruch as Chief Executive Officer and Director of IsoEnergy. Mr. Gabruch will be taking over the role from Mr. Craig Parry who will step down as President and Chief Executive Officer and continue to serve the Company as a member of the Board of Directors. \r\n\r\n Leigh Curyer, Chairman of the Board, commented: “On behalf of the Board of IsoEnergy, I am very pleased to welcome Tim as Chief Executive Officer and Director.  Tim’s knowledge of nuclear fuel markets and corporate development in the nuclear industry will be integral to executing IsoEnergy’s strategy of exploration and development.  With outstanding Saskatchewan assets serving as the foundation of IsoEnergy, we are also proud to be repositioning leadership of the company to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. \r\n\r\n Further, and on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Craig as a co-founder of IsoEnergy for his leadership over the past five years.  IsoEnergy was founded in 2016 to explore and grow its portfolio of high impact uranium projects in Saskatchewan’s Eastern Athabasca Basin. During Craig’s tenure, IsoEnergy has acquired and financed a highly strategic Eastern Athabasca Basin land position of high caliber prospective uranium properties and discovered the Hurricane zone in July 2018, which will be a focus of 2021 drilling activities.” \r\n\r\n Tim Gabruch, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “I am very excited to join IsoEnergy and look forward to growing its high-grade uranium discovery at Hurricane.  The NexGen group have created a winning formula for exploration and development in the uranium space and I am confident my skills and experience will help IsoEnergy in its next phase of exploration and overall development of the company.  It’s an exciting time in the nuclear industry, with the demand for clean nuclear energy growing. The past decade has been a tough one for uranium suppliers and has resulted in supply-side stress in the global uranium market. With the sector beginning to turn around, the world will need projects like Hurricane and more Canadian uranium discoveries like it to help meet future demand.” \r\n\r\n Craig Parry, former Chief Executive Officer, commented: “It has been my great privilege to lead IsoEnergy and its outstanding team. I thank the Board and our major shareholder NexGen Energy for their support over the past five years. I step aside as CEO with the Company well financed and in a strong position to continue advancing our high-grade Hurricane discovery and large portfolio of Athabascan exploration projects. I look forward to remaining involved with the company and helping drive our projects forward.” \r\n\r\n Tim Gabruch \r\n\r\n Tim brings over 25 years of experience in the uranium mining and nuclear energy industries. Most recently, Tim was Vice President Commercial with Denison Mines Corp (“Denison”) where he led the company’s commercial function in support of development of its flagship Wheeler River uranium project. He also acted as Chief Commercial Officer of Uranium Participation Corporation during this period. Previously, Tim spent more than 20 years with Cameco Corporation (\"Cameco\") in various marketing and corporate development roles, having served as Vice President Marketing, from 2011 to 2017. During that period, he led a diverse corporate marketing team tasked with delivering more than 30 million pounds of uranium annually and contributed to key management decisions as a member of Cameco’s executive management committee. Prior to that, Tim worked in several senior roles at Cameco including Director, Corporate Development in which he led various acquisitions and international investment opportunities. Additionally, he held several uranium marketing and trading roles, where over several years he dealt directly with most of the world’s nuclear power utilities. Tim also worked with the World Nuclear Association's predecessor organization, the Uranium Institute, on secondment from Cameco.  Tim currently serves on the board of TAM International, a leading global transporter of radioactive materials and is a past board member of Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership (STEP), a joint government/private non-profit organization that champions the province's export industry. IsoEnergy is 53% owned by NexGen Energy. Tim will also be providing uranium marketing advisory to NexGen Energy. \r\n\r\n Craig Parry \r\n\r\n In 2011, Craig through his role at Tigers Realm Minerals, was a co-founding inaugural financier and formerly a Director of NexGen Energy.  Together with the NexGen Energy Board founding IsoEnergy in 2016, Craig led the team and company to successfully build, finance and explore one of the largest uranium exploration portfolios in the Eastern Athabasca Basin. Craig and the team’s efforts resulted in the discovery of the Hurricane zone in 2018. \r\n\r\n About IsoEnergy \r\n\r\n IsoEnergy is a well-funded uranium exploration and development company with a portfolio of prospective projects in the eastern Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada.  The Company recently discovered the high-grade Hurricane zone of uranium mineralization on its 100% owned Larocque East property in the Eastern Athabasca Basin.  IsoEnergy is led by a Board and Management team with a track record of success in uranium exploration, development and operations.  The Company was founded and is supported by the team at its major shareholder, NexGen Energy Ltd.   \r\n\r\n Tim Gabruch \r\n Chief Executive Officer  \r\n IsoEnergy Ltd. \r\n+1 306 261-6284 \r\n tgabruch@isoenergy.ca   www.isoenergy.ca   \r\n\r\n Investor Relations \r\n Kin Communications \r\n+1 604 684 6730 \r\n iso@kincommunications.com \r\n www.isoenergy.ca \r\n\r\n Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulations Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. \r\n\r\n This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
