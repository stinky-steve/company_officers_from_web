While market conditions remain challenging, management and the board are working hard to identify cost savings opportunities in capital, operating and financing costs of the Project. And they are actively seeking opportunities to finance the project. Management and the board believe in the potential of the Wynyard Carnallite Project and that its development will provide significant shareholder value.” said Karnalyte’s interim Chief Executive Officer, W. Todd Rowan. \n THIRD QUARTER Update \n In order to conclude the work done during the optimization program in 2016 (the “ Optimization Program ”), the following activities have been taking place at the Wynyard Carnallite Project site: \n \n Cavern Testing – To gain an understanding of the final shape and conditions in the cavern, the Company intends to take sonar and blanket oil level logs, and temperature readings in the test cavern. The Company intends to deliver these logs to the Company’s consultant, ERCOSPLAN Ingenieurgesellschaft Geotechnik und Bergbau mbH, for analysis and a final update to their report on the Optimization Program. \n Magnesium Testing – production brine containing MgCl 2  was extracted from the Belle Plaine zone in the test cavern and taken to the Saskatchewan Research Council for further testing. The aim was to explore the potential of producing high purity 99% plus Magnesium Compounds in a variety of specified formulations that could meet different industrial specifications. SRC completed the lab processing work in September and will provide data from the tests. Karnalyte also intends to perform an evaluation of the potential markets for MgCl 2  brine, Basic Magnesium Carbonate (BMC) and MgO and to incorporate this into a final report. \n Decommissioning 2016 cavern testing site – Karnalyte has largely decommissioned the site of the Optimization Program in accordance with the operating permit from the Government of Saskatchewan. All rental equipment has been returned and Company owned equipment and material has been moved to the permanent storage yard. This cleanup also further prepares the site for Phase I construction. \n Disposal Well Temperature Log – To fulfill a condition of the licence for the disposal well, the Company intends to carry out a routine temperature log in November to ensure that the continued integrity of the well is being maintained. The work is also expected to open up the allowed two disposal zones, increasing the well’s disposal capacity; some extra regulatory work is being done to permit and secure the overall disposal system. \n To comply with terms of the environmental impact statement, the Company has engaged a consultant to prepare an updated decommissioning and reclamation plan for the overall Wynyard Carnallite Project area. \n \n About Karnalyte Resources Inc. \n Karnalyte is a Saskatchewan-headquartered company focused on exploration and development of potash and magnesium in Saskatchewan.
