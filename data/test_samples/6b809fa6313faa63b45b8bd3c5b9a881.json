(“Karnalyte” or “the Company”) (TSX:KRN) today reported further voting support for all management nominees and resolutions at the upcoming Annual and Special Meeting (AGM) of Karnalyte shareholders, and reminded shareholders who have not yet voted of the proxy voting deadline of 9:30 a.m. (Saskatoon time) on Tuesday, June 5, 2018. Karnalyte encourages the engagement of all its shareholders and urges all shareholders to vote FOR all management nominees and resolutions regardless of how many shares you hold. \n Commented Peter Matson, a member of Karnalyte’s Board, and Karnalyte’s 3 rd  largest shareholder: “We are encouraged by the support we have received for our plan to turn the page on Karnalyte’s past, and our vision for future value creation. Our team has put in place a clear and executable strategy for value creation in the fertilizer industry in addition to our flagship Wynyard potash property, and we are eager to deliver on this plan for the benefit of all shareholders. The AGM is an important opportunity for shareholders to send a strong message in favour of progress, growth and value creation, and we encourage all shareholders to vote before the proxy deadline of June 5.” \n Announced on May 14, 2018, Karnalyte’s strategic plan is centred on expanding the value-creation opportunities for the Company in the fertilizer industry.  Karnlayte’s two-pronged strategy consists of keeping its flagship potash project construction ready while we wait for potash prices to recover, together with exploring the development of a small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant in central Saskatchewan.  Benefits of this strategic plan to shareholders include: \n \n Following the industry trend of diversification into multiple fertilizer product lines \n Preserving the value of the Wynyard project for an ultimate recovery in potash prices \n Capitalizing on Saskatchewan’s competitive advantages for nitrogen fertilizer production \n Providing both international and domestic market opportunities for Karnalyte’s fertilizer products \n \n GSFC, Karnalyte’s largest shareholder and strategic partner, has more than five decades’ experience in nitrogen fertilizer production, and fully supports the Company’s potash and nitrogen fertilizer strategy. \n VOTE NOW FOR A CLEAR PATH TO VALUE CREATION \n Karnalyte urges all shareholders to join with GSFC and the Board and vote FOR all management nominees before the proxy cut-off of 9:30 a.m. (Saskatoon time) on Tuesday, June 5, 2018. \n For questions or assistance voting their shares, shareholders should contact D.F.
