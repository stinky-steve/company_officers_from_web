(“IsoEnergy”, “ISO” or the “Company”) (TSX: ISO; OTCQX: ISENF)  is pleased to announce that it has completed the sale (the “ Transaction ”) to Jaguar Uranium Corp. (“ Jaguar ”) of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares (the “ Target Shares ”) of a wholly-owned subsidiary of IsoEnergy, which holds, indirectly, a 100% interest in the Laguna Salada Project located in Chubut and the Huemul Project located in Mendoza (together the “ Properties ”).  Jaguar is an arm’s length privately held company focused on the uranium sector with strong operating experience in Latin America and intends to pursue a listing on a recognized stock exchange in North America (the “ Listing ”) in the coming months. \r\n\r\n Transaction Highlights \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Demonstrates Execution of Business Plan –  The Transaction aligns with the Company’s strategy to maximize shareholder value through accretive opportunities, demonstrating its ability to leverage non-core assets in favourable market conditions. \r\n\t Enhances Focus on Core Jurisdictions –  The Company maintains a focused production strategy, prioritizing near-term production in the US and ongoing development and exploration in Canada and Australia, all three of which are top uranium jurisdictions. The Transaction allows for the efficient allocation of resources and capital, maximizing the value of core assets. \r\n\t Bolsters Equity Portfolio While Retaining Upside Potential –  With a history of successful accretive M&A, the Transaction will enhance the Company’s equity portfolio, which is estimated at C$16.9 million 1  and includes holdings in NexGen Energy Ltd., Premier American Uranium Inc. and Atha Energy Corp., by adding approximately C$13.6 million in value. Additionally, IsoEnergy will enter into an investor rights agreement, securing continued exposure as the Properties are advanced through the right to participate in future equity financings and the right to elect one representative to the board of Jaguar. \r\n\t Unlocks Value Through Expertise in Latin America –  The Properties will be in the hands of Jaguar, a well-capitalized company with proven technical and operational expertise in Latin America, ensuring successful exploration and development. \r\n \r\n\r\n Philip Williams, CEO and Director of IsoEnergy, commented, “Since the merger with Consolidated Uranium late last year, IsoEnergy has been largely focused on advancing the Larocque East project in the Athabasca Basin, host to the high-grade Hurricane Deposit, and restarting its past producing uranium mines in Utah, the Tony M, Daneros and Rim Mines. At the same time, we have been pursuing opportunistic transactions to realize value from “non-core” assets in the portfolio. Today’s announcement is one such transaction. We firmly believe that every uranium pound in every jurisdiction will be required to meet expected future uranium demand and Jaguar, with its Berlin project in Colombia and now the IsoEnergy Argentinian Properties, has an important role to play in South America. By taking equity as consideration IsoEnergy remains exposed to the upside in Jaguar shares and we look forward to supporting the company and its accomplished leadership team going forward.” \r\n\r\n Transaction Details  \r\n\r\n As consideration for the acquisition of the Target Shares, Jaguar has agreed to deliver to the Company (collectively, the “ Consideration ”): \r\n\r\n (a) upon closing of the Transaction (“ Closing ”): \r\n\r\n \r\n\t  USD$10 million of Class A common shares of Jaguar (the  “Jaguar Shares ”), being 2,000,000 Jaguar Shares at a deemed price of USD$5.00 per share. \r\n\t A 2% net smelter returns (NSR) royalty payable on all production from the Laguna Salada Project.
