Mr. Robin Phinney P Eng. and Mr. Gary Derdall, Ph D of Saskatoon 1999 co-authored a paper that provided the petrochemical industry a cheap and easy solution to remove their greenhouse gasses from  the atmosphere. “Carbon fixing by fertilizing the forest and commercial agricultural crops to offset the use of fossil fuels”.   Karnalyte now has developed KCL99™ a unique water soluble 99.4% pure granular potash fertilizer ideal for fertilizing by aircraft as envisioned in his paper. \n \n                                     \n                     \n             \n             2016 \n                             \n                                             \n     Aug 31, 2016 \n     BNN \n \n     BBN Interview With Robin Phinney – Wednesday, August 31, 2016 \n \n     Interview With Robin Phinney CEO of Karnalyte Resources Starts at the 15 min.
