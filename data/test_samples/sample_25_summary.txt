[The Zgounder series is divided into three units, which are in stratigraphic order: 
1) The Blue Formation (300-400m) consisting of sandstone, greywacke and shale with layers of tuff and quartz keratophyre followed by an orange rhyolitic unit; 
2) The Brown Formation composed of 350 to 450m of micaceous schistose sandstone overlain by a 45m thick dolerite sill/dyke; and 
3), The 900m-thick Black Formation containing at its base a felsic volcanic complex (ignimbrite, rhyolitic breccia, divitrivied rhyolite) and forming the hanging rock of the Ag-mineralization over the Brown Formation.]

[There are four types of faulting and fracturing present at Zgounder: 
1) an EW-oriented system corresponding to the opening and filling of fractures with argillaceous material and to subvertical fractures; 2) a NS-oriented system with a northward reject; 
3) a NNE-NNW-oriented system dipping 60 to 75°E; and 
4) a subhorizontal system oriented NNE-SSW that generated a staircase collapse of the Brown Formation toward the north.
