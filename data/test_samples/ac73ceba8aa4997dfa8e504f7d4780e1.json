(“ IsoEnergy ” or the “ Company ”) ( TSXV: ISO; OTCQX: ISENF ) is pleased to report that an aggressive winter drilling program has commenced at the Hurricane zone. The Hurricane zone is a new discovery of high-grade uranium mineralization on the Company’s 100% owned Larocque East property (the “ Property ”) in the Eastern Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan (Figures 1 & 2). \r\n\r\n Drilling Program Summary: \r\n\r\n \r\n\t 8,500 metres planned in approximately 20 drill holes \r\n\t Infill drilling to further define 500m long mineralized trend \r\n\t Expansion drilling to evaluate potential to expand along-strike both east and west \r\n \r\n\r\n Craig Parry, President, CEO and Director commented: “IsoEnergy commences 2020 with $7 million in the treasury which sees the company fully funded for our exploration programs this year. We will be drilling at our Hurricane high-grade uranium discovery where mineralization is open along strike and on most sections. We very much look forward to reporting the results of the program over the coming months.” \r\n\r\n Steve Blower, Vice President of Exploration commented: “Good cold winter conditions have allowed us to start the winter drilling program on schedule. Crews and equipment have been mobilized to site and the first drill hole has been collared. Two drills are being employed for the first time at the Hurricane zone – one infilling the current 500m long mineralized footprint and expanding it along-strike to the west, and the other focused on expansion of the zone along-strike to the east.” \r\n\r\n Program Details \r\n\r\n The planned winter core drilling campaign consists of a total of 8,500 m in approximately 20 drill holes. The program has two main objectives – infill and expansion (Figure 3). \r\n\r\n One drill will infill the current 500 m long footprint of the Hurricane zone and attempt to expand it to the west, where a 75m gap remains between the westernmost drill hole (LE19-12) and the property boundary. Drill hole LE19-12 intersected 3.2% U 3 O 8  and 2.1% Ni over 8.5m in 2019. Most cross-sections remain open, including section 4635E where drill hole LE19-16A intersected 5.4% U 3 O 8  over 7.0 m. Infill drilling will also target along-strike gaps of up to 250 m between drill sections. \r\n\r\n The second drill will evaluate the potential to expand the zone to the east. This will include following up on the strong alteration and elevated geochemistry and radioactivity in step-out drill hole LE19-26 (Figure 4), the only drill hole completed by the Company to date that is beyond the 500m long Hurricane zone footprint. Results from a DC-Resistivity geophysical survey completed in the summer of 2019 support the highly prospective nature of the area, which extends for several kilometres to the east. Drilling metres and holes are expected to be split approximately equally between both objectives. Results of the program will be reported periodically through the winter. \r\n\r\n The Larocque East Property and the Hurricane Zone \r\n\r\n The 100% owned Larocque East property consists of 20 mineral claims totaling 8,371 ha and is not encumbered by any royalties or other interests. Larocque East is immediately adjacent to the north end of IsoEnergy’s Geiger property and is 35 km northwest of Orano Canada’s McClean Lake uranium mine and mill. \r\n\r\n Along with other target areas, the Property covers a 15-kilometre-long northeast extension of the Larocque Lake conductor system; a trend of graphitic metasedimentary basement rocks that is associated with significant uranium mineralization at the Hurricane zone, and in several occurrences on Cameco Corp.’s neighbouring property to the southwest of Larocque East. The Hurricane zone was discovered in July, 2018 and was followed up with a 12-hole drilling campaign in the winter of 2019 and a recently completed 17-hole summer 2019 drilling campaign. Dimensions are currently 500m along-strike, 40m wide and up to 10m thick. The zone is open for expansion along-strike and on most sections. Mineralization is polymetallic and commonly straddles the sub-Athabasca unconformity 320 m below surface. The best intersection to date is 5.4% U 3 O 8  over 7.0m in drill hole LE19-16A. Drilling at Cameco Corp.’s Larocque Lake zone on the neighbouring property to the southwest has returned historical intersections of up to 29.9% U 3 O 8  over 7.0 m in drill hole Q22-040. Like the nearby Geiger property, Larocque East is located adjacent to the Wollaston-Mudjatik transition zone - a major crustal suture related to most of the major uranium deposits in the eastern Athabasca Basin. Importantly, the sandstone cover on the Property is thin, ranging between 140 m and 330 m in previous drilling. In addition to the Hurricane zone discovery, four historical drill holes have intersected weak uranium mineralization at other locations on the Property to date. \r\n\r\n Figure 1 – Larocque East Property Map \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 2 – Hurricane Zone Drill Hole Location Map \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 3 – Winter 2020 Planned Drilling Areas \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 4 – Planned Follow-up Drilling on the 5185E Section \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Qualified Person Statement \r\n\r\n The scientific and technical information contained in this news release was prepared by Andy Carmichael, P.Geo., IsoEnergy’s Senior Geologist, who is a “Qualified Person” (as defined in NI 43-101 –  Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ). Mr. Carmichael has verified the data disclosed. As mineralized drill holes at the Hurricane zone are oriented very steeply (-80 to -90 degrees) into a zone of mineralization that is interpreted to be horizontal, the true thickness of the intersections is expected to be greater than or equal to 90% of the core lengths. This news release refers to properties other than those in which the Company has an interest. Mineralization on those other properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization on the Company’s properties.
