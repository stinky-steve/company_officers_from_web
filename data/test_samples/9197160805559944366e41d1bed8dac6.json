(“ Karnalyte ” or the “ Company “) (TSX: KRN) today announced its financial results and corporate highlights for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n Q3 2024 HIGHLIGHTS \n UPDATE ON NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 COMPLIANT TECHNICAL REPORT \n The Company continued to make progress on its NI 43-101 compliant technical report, a key precursor to any mine construction. In the third quarter, this included work on the equipment sourcing initiative that the Company previously announced. In pursuit of cost savings, the Company is analyzing cost efficiencies from sourcing certain equipment from overseas and expects to provide an update in the fourth quarter of the year. This initiative is being supported by our strategic partner, Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals (“GSFC”). The cost savings initiative is being led by Wood PLC, a leading global consulting and engineering company that is the independent lead author of the update. \n As previously announced, industry leading solution mining and engineering firm ERCOSPLAN ingenieurgesellschaft Geotechnik und Bergbau mbH (“ERCOSPLAN”) is assisting with the technical report, including the update of the mineral resource estimation and the mine plan for brine field development as the basis for the mineral reserve estimate. \n REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY \n During the quarter, the Company announced it will begin a review of its development strategy to evaluate the economic potential of increasing magnesium chloride production at the Company’s Wynyard Project by developing the magnesium assets at the same time as the development of the potash project. \n Carnallite, also known as hydrated potassium magnesium chloride, is abundant within the Company’s mineral deposit. As part of its review, the Company has begun preliminary studies to evaluate the economic opportunity of developing carnallite for the co-production of magnesium chloride and potassium chloride. The aim is to significantly increase magnesium chloride production, compared to previous studies, through the use of advanced solution mining technologies. \n Magnesium is listed as one of Canada’s 34 critical minerals and is a key mineral in the clean technologies and advanced manufacturing value chains. Additionally, Magnesium chloride serves as a key raw material in the production of various chemicals, including magnesium metal, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, and magnesium carbonate. These chemicals are used in high-tech applications such as semiconductor manufacturing, lithium-ion battery production, and in industries including metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and wastewater treatment, driving the demand for magnesium chloride. \n Permanent Appointments of CEO and CFO  \n On August 14, the Company announced the appointment of Danielle Favreau as permanent Chief Executive Officer and Christie Gradin as permanent Chief Financial Officer of the Company. \n Strategic Asset Sale of Surplus Equipment \n During the quarter, the Company sold certain non-essential assets from its Wynyard Project as part of its ongoing efforts to optimize its business operations and advance the project. As a result of this sale, the company realized net proceeds of $261,000. \n OUTLOOK FOR 2024 \n In 2024, the Company’s plans are as follows: \n \n Continue to make progress on the update to its NI 43-101 technical report; \n Continue to work on identifying cost efficiencies; and \n Continue work on its development strategy review. \n \n 2024 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS \n At Sept 30, 2024, the Company had cash of $1 million and positive net working capital of $882,000 and no debt.

Karnalyte owns the construction ready Wynyard Potash Project, with planned phase 1 production of 625,000 tonnes per year (“ TPY ”) of high grade granular potash, and two subsequent phases of 750,000 TPY each, taking total production up to 2.125 million TPY. Karnalyte is also exploring the development of the Proteos Nitrogen Project, which is a proposed small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant with a nameplate production capacity of approximately 700 metric tonnes per day (“ MTPD ”) of ammonia and approximately 1,200 MTPD of urea, and a target customer market of independent fertilizer wholesalers in Central Saskatchewan. \n About the Wynyard Potash Project \n The Wynyard Potash Project is a construction ready solution mining potash project located in Wynyard, Saskatchewan, with planned phase 1 production of 625,000 TPY of high grade granular potash, and two subsequent phases of 750,000 TPY each, taking total production up to 2.125 million TPY. All environmental permits remain valid, preliminary detailed engineering is complete, and the existing offtake agreement with Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited remains in effect. Further development is dependent on the continued strength of potash prices and obtaining financing. \n About the Proteos Nitrogen Project \n The Proteos Nitrogen Project is an advanced stage development project consisting of a proposed small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant to be located in Central Saskatchewan, having a nameplate production capacity of approximately 700 MTPD of ammonia and approximately 1,200 MTPD of urea, and designed to produce two products – anhydrous ammonia (82-0-0) and granular urea (46-0-0). Karnalyte’s primary target market is independent local Saskatchewan fertilizer wholesalers within a 400-kilometer radius of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. A secondary target market is the US Midwest fertilizer wholesalers near to the Canadian – United States border. The proposed plant would be the first greenfield nitrogen fertilizer plant built in Canada in the last 26 years. \n About Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited \n Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited (“ GSFC ”) is a leading Indian Fortune 500 chemicals and fertilizer company that has been in business for more than 50 years.
