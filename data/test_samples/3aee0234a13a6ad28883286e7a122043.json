(“ IsoEnergy ”) (TSX: ISO; OTCQX: ISENF) and Anfield Energy Inc. (“ Anfield ”)  (TSX.V: AEC; OTCQB: ANLDF; FRANKFURT: 0AD)  are pleased to announce that they have entered into a definitive agreement (the “ Arrangement Agreement ”) pursuant to which IsoEnergy will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Anfield (the “ Anfield Shares ”) by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement (the “ Transaction ”). Anfield owns 100% of the Shootaring Canyon Mill (the “ Mill ”) located in southeastern Utah, United States, one of only three licensed, permitted, and constructed conventional uranium mills in the United States, as well as a portfolio of conventional uranium and vanadium projects in Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona (Figure 1). \r\n\r\n Under the terms of the Transaction, Anfield shareholders will receive 0.031 of a common share of IsoEnergy (each whole share, an “ ISO Share ”) for each Anfield Share held (the “ Exchange Ratio ”). Existing shareholders of IsoEnergy and Anfield will own approximately 83.8% and 16.2% on a fully-diluted in the-money basis, respectively, of the outstanding ISO Shares on closing of the Transaction. \r\n\r\n The Exchange Ratio implies consideration of $0.103 per Anfield Share, based on the closing price of the ISO Shares over all Canadian exchanges on October 1, 2024. Based on each company’s 20-day volume weighted average trading price over all Canadian exchanges for the period ending October 1, 2024, the Exchange Ratio implies a premium of 32.1% to the Anfield Share price. The implied fully-diluted in the-money equity value of the Transaction is equal to approximately $126.8 million. \r\n\r\n Strategic Rationale  \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Expected to Expand Near-Term U.S. Uranium Production Capacity –  The combined portfolio (“ Combined Portfolio ”) of permitted past-producing mines and development projects in the Western U.S. (Figure 1) is expected to provide for substantial increased uranium production potential in the short, medium and long term. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Ownership of Shootaring Canyon Mill Secures Access to Two of Only Three U.S. Permitted Conventional Uranium Mills – \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\t\t A restart application has been submitted to the State of Utah for the Shootaring Canyon Mill to increase throughput from 750 stpd to 1,000 stpd and expand licensed annual production capacity from 1 million lbs U 3 O 8  to 3 million lbs U 3 O 8 . \r\n\t\t Existing toll-milling agreements with Energy Fuels at the White Mesa Mill provide additional processing flexibility for current IsoEnergy mines. \r\n\t \r\n\t \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Meaningful Growth in U.S. Uranium Mineral Endowment –  With combined current mineral resources of 17.0 Mlbs Measured & Indicated (+157%) and 10.6 Mlbs Inferred (+382%) 1 , and historical mineral resources of 152.0 Mlbs Measured & Indicated (+14%), and 40.4 Mlbs Inferred 2  (+33%), the proforma company will rank among the largest in the U.S. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Complementary Project Portfolio Provides Immediate Operational Synergies –  Benefits from the proximity of the Combined Portfolio in Utah and Colorado are expected to include, reduced transportation costs, increased operational flexibility for mining and processing, reduction in G&A on a per lb basis, and risk diversification through multiple production sources. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Aligned with Goal of Building a Multi-Asset Uranium Producer in Tier-One Jurisdictions –  Beyond the impressive Combined Portfolio in the U.S., the proforma company will have a robust pipeline of development and exploration-stage projects in tier-one uranium jurisdictions, including the world’s highest grade published Indicated uranium resource in Canada’s Athabasca Basin. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Well-Timed to Capitalize on Strong Momentum in the Nuclear Industry   –  Recent industry headlines relating to increasing demand and support for nuclear power are expected to drive uranium demand and by extension prices, coinciding with expected production and development of the Combined Portfolio. \r\n \r\n\r\n CEO and Director of IsoEnergy, Philip Williams, commented, “IsoEnergy is committed to becoming a globally significant, multi-asset uranium producer in the world’s top uranium mining jurisdictions. The U.S. is a key jurisdiction for us, and we believe today’s acquisition of Anfield strengthens both our resource base and near-term production potential. The combined uranium mineral endowment will rank as one of the largest in the U.S., supported by a 100% owned processing facility, multiple fully permitted mines ready for rapid restart, and a strong pipeline of longer-term development projects. \r\n\r\n With the global shift towards nuclear power, we believe the outlook for uranium has never been stronger, making this a pivotal move for IsoEnergy at the right time. We commend the Anfield team for assembling and managing this impressive portfolio over the years, and we look forward to advancing these assets back into production into a time of anticipated rising demand for uranium.” \r\n\r\n CEO and Director of Anfield, Corey Dias, commented, “We believe this Transaction represents an excellent opportunity for Anfield shareholders, and the culmination of our team’s strategic approach to assembling a unique, U.S.-focused portfolio of potential near-term uranium production assets. This Transaction underscores our view that Anfield acquired the right assets in the right place at the right time.” \r\n\r\n “Beyond the immediate share price premium, shareholders will gain exposure to a broad array of uranium projects, from the high grade and strategically located Hurricane project in Saskatchewan to a large inventory of earlier stage resource assets. The most fundamental benefit of the Transaction is the high level of economic synergies that we believe will be generated by the marriage of our mill and mining assets with IsoEnergy’s U.S. mining assets, particularly the advanced stage Tony M mine which is located within 4 miles of our Shootaring Canyon mill. Other tangential benefits to Anfield shareholders will include higher levels of trading liquidity, a robust combined balance sheet, and exposure to extensive research analyst coverage and institutional ownership. We look forward to working with the IsoEnergy team to complete the Transaction and to integrating our two platforms with a view to revitalize American uranium mining in pursuit of clean, domestic energy security.” \r\n\r\n Benefits to IsoEnergy Shareholders \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Secures Shootaring Canyon Mill,  one of only three permitted conventional uranium mills in the U.S., located adjacent to IsoEnergy’s Tony M Mine \r\n\t Diversified access to both Shootaring Canyon and White Mesa Mills to boost near-term production capacity  while unlocking anticipated operational synergies \r\n\t Strengthens ranking among the U.S. uranium players  in terms of production capacity, advanced mining assets and resource exposure \r\n\t Potential re-rating from de-risking near-term potential production, increased scale, asset diversification  within the U.S. and additional exploration upside \r\n\t A combined company backed by corporate and institutional investors of Anfield  including, enCore Energy Corp. \r\n\t Creation of a larger platform with greater scale for M&A, access to capital and liquidity \r\n \r\n\r\n Benefits to Anfield Shareholders \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Immediate and attractive premium \r\n\t Exposure to a larger, more diversified portfolio  of high-quality uranium exploration, development and near-term production assets in tier one jurisdictions of U.S., Canada and Australia  \r\n\t Entry into the Athabasca Basin , a leading uranium jurisdiction, with the high-grade Hurricane deposit \r\n\t Upside from an accelerated path to potential production  as well as from synergies with IsoEnergy’s other Utah uranium assets  \r\n\t A combined company backed by corporate and institutional investors of IsoEnergy  including, NexGen Energy Ltd., Energy Fuels Inc., Mega Uranium Ltd. and uranium ETFs \r\n\t Participation in a larger platform with greater scale for M&A \r\n\t Increased scale expected to provide greater access to capital, trading liquidity and research coverage \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 1: IsoEnergy and Anfield Combined Portfolio of permitted past producing mines and development projects in the Western U.S. 3 \r\n\r\n Shootaring Canyon Mill and Velvet-Wood and Slick Rock Uranium Projects \r\n\r\n Located approximately 48 miles (77 kilometers) south of Hanksville, Utah and 4 miles from IsoEnergy’s Tony M Mine, the Shootaring Canyon Mill is one of three licensed, permitted and constructed conventional uranium mills in the United States. Built in 1980 by Plateau Resources, the mill commenced operations in 1982 but ceased operations due to the decline in the uranium price after approximately six months of operation. Despite its relatively short period of operation, the Mill historically produced and sold 27,825 lbs of U 3 O 8 . The Mill has not been decommissioned and has been under care and maintenance since cessation of operations. The Shootaring Canyon Mill has a radioactive source materials license on Standby status which will need to be amended, among other things, to allow Mill operations to resume. \r\n\r\n In May 2023, Anfield completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment assuming that mineral processing of the Velvet-Wood and Slick Rock Projects would take place at the Shootaring Canyon Mill. \r\n\r\n The Velvet-Wood project is a 2,425-acre property located in the Lisbon Valley uranium district of San Juan County, Utah, which was previously the largest uranium producing district in Utah. The Velvet-Wood Uranium project consists of two areas with mineral resources as outlined below. \r\n\r\n Past production from underground mines in the Velvet area during 1979 to 1984 yielded significant results, recovering around 4 Mlbs of U 3 O 8  and 5 Mlbs of V 2 O 5  from mining approximately 400,000 tons of ore with grades of 0.46% U 3 O 8  and 0.64% V 2 O 5 . The Velvet mine retains underground infrastructure, including a 3,500 ft long, 12′ x 9′ decline to the uranium deposit. Along with the Tony M Mine, the Velvet-Wood Project is the most advanced uranium asset in the Combined Portfolio and is believed to represent a potential near-term path to uranium and vanadium production. \r\n\r\n Table 1: Velvet-Wood and Slick Rock Uranium Mineral Resource Summary Effective April 30, 2023 \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t See Preliminary Economic Assessment for Velvet-Wood/Slick Rock entitled “The Shootaring Canyon Mill and Velvet-Wood And Slick Rock Uranium Projects, Preliminary Economic Assessment, National Instrument 43-101” dated May 6, 2023 was authored by Douglas L. Beahm, P.E., P.G. Principal Engineer, Harold H. Hutson, P.E., P.G. and Carl D. Warren, P.E., P.G. of BRS Inc. Terence P. (Terry) McNulty, P.E., D. Sc, of T.P. McNulty and Associates Inc.  \r\n\t Reported in accordance with CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources & Reserves (2014). \r\n\t GT cut-off varies by locality from 0.25-0.40 for eU3O8 and 0.25-0.50 for V2O5 \r\n\t Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. However, reasonable prospects for future economic extraction were applied to the mineral resource estimates herein through consideration of grade and GT cutoffs as well as mineralization proximity to existing and proposed conceptual mining. As such, economic considerations were exercised by screening out areas which were below these cutoffs or of isolated mineralization and thus would not support the cost of conventional mining under current and reasonably foreseeable conditions. \r\n\t The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues, although Anfield is aware of any such issues.  \r\n\t V 2 O 5  mineral resources were estimated based primarily on documented vanadium: uranium production ratios and are thus considered inferred mineral resources.  \r\n \r\n\r\n The Slick Rock property is an advanced stage conventional uranium and vanadium project located in San Miguel County, Colorado. The project consists of 315 contiguous mineral lode claims and covers approximately 5,333 acres. Past production came from the upper or third-rim sandstone of the Salt Wash member of the Morrison Formation. This is the target host for uranium/vanadium mineralization within Anfield’s Slick Rock project area. \r\n\r\n Board of Directors’ Recommendations \r\n\r\n The Arrangement Agreement has been unanimously approved at meetings of the board of directors of each of IsoEnergy and Anfield, including, in the case of Anfield, following, among other things, the receipt of the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent directors of Anfield. Evans & Evans, Inc. provided an opinion to the special committee of Anfield and Haywood Securities Inc. provided an opinion to the board of directors of Anfield, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, the consideration to be received by Anfield shareholders pursuant to the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Anfield shareholders, subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth in such opinion.

In each instance, the reliability of the historical estimate is considered reasonable, but a Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource, and IsoEnergy is not treating the historical estimate as a current mineral resource. The historical information provides an indication of the exploration potential of the properties but may not be representative of expected results. \r\n\r\n For the Daneros Mine, as disclosed in the above noted technical report, the historical estimate was prepared by Energy Fuels using a wireframe model of the mineralized zone based on an outside bound of a 0.05% eu3o8 grade cutoff at a minimum thickness of 1 foot. Surface drilling would need to be conducted to confirm resources and connectivity of resources in order to verify the Daneros historical estimate as a current mineral resource. \r\n\r\n For the Sage Plain Project, as disclosed in the above noted technical report, the historical estimate was prepared by Peters Geosciences using a modified polygonal method. An exploration program would need to be conducted, including twinning of historical drill holes, in order to verify the Sage Plain historical estimate as a current mineral resource.  \r\n\r\n For the Coles Hill Project, as disclosed in the above noted revised preliminary economic assessment, the historical estimated was prepared by John I Kyle of Lyntek Incorporated. Twinning of a selection of certain holes would need to be completed along with updating of mining, processing and certain cost estimates in order to verify the Coles Hill Project historical resource estimate as a current mineral resource estimate. \r\n\r\n Marquez-Juan Tafoya: reported by enCore Energy Corporation in a technical report entitled “Marquez-Juan Tafoya Uranium Project, 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment” dated effective June 9, 2021, prepared by Douglas L.
