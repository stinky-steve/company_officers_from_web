Karnalyte has written the letter to shareholders as such shareholders are flagrantly ignoring basic corporate and securities laws, as well as long established Karnalyte corporate policies. \n Evidence of the transgressions of these self-interested individuals are all comprehensively documented in Karnalyte’s corporate records. \n Vote FOR all management nominees \n Karnalyte shareholders are urged to read the complete letter to shareholders and vote FOR all management nominees before the deadline of 9:30 a.m. (Saskatoon time) on Tuesday, June 5, 2018. \n Shareholders can vote their shares by telephone by contacting AST Trust Company (Canada), Karnalyte’s Registrar and Transfer Agent toll-free at: 1-888-489-7352. \n For further information, please contact: \n Frank D.
