(“ IsoEnergy ” or the “ Company ”) ( TSXV: ISO; OTCQX: ISENF ) is pleased to announce the initial independent Mineral Resource Estimate (the “Resource Estimate”) for the Hurricane uranium deposit on its 100% owned Larocque East project in the eastern Athabasca Basin of Saskatchewan. \r\n\r\n Highlights \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Indicated Mineral Resources of 48.61 million lbs of U 3 O 8  based on 63,800 tonnes grading 34.5% U 3 O 8 , including 43.89 million lbs U 3 O 8  at an average grade of 52.1% U 3 O 8  within the high-grade domain \r\n\t Inferred Mineral Resources of 2.66 million lbs of U 3 O 8  based on 54,300 tonnes grading 2.2% U 3 O 8 \r\n\t Indicated Mineral Resources are highly insensitive to cut-off grade due to the high-grade and compact nature of the Hurricane Deposit (refer Table 2) \r\n \r\n\r\n Table 1 – Summary of Hurricane Attributable Mineral Resources (as of July 8, 2022) \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Notes: \r\n\r\n \r\n\t CIM (2014) definitions were followed for all Mineral Resource categories. \r\n\t Mineral Resources are estimated at a uranium cut-off grade of 1.00% U 3 O 8 . \r\n\t Tonnes are based on bulk density weighting. \r\n\t Mineral Resources are estimated using a long-term uranium price of US$65/lb. \r\n\t Minimum grade width of one metre was applied to the resource domain wireframes. \r\n\t Bulk density was interpolated using values derived from a regression curve based on U 3 O 8  assay values. \r\n\t Numbers may not add due to rounding. \r\n \r\n\r\n Table 2 – Hurricane Block Model Sensitivity to Cut-Off Grade (as of July 8, 2022) \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Note: Mineral Resources are estimated at a uranium cut off grade of 1.0% U 3 O 8 \r\n\r\n Tim Gabruch, President and Chief Executive Officer commented: “Since incorporation by NexGen Energy in 2016, IsoEnergy’s objective has been to explore for high-grade uranium on the eastern side of Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin.  Following the discovery of Hurricane in July 2018 IsoEnergy has focused on determining the scope and scale of the deposit. The six drilling programs completed since then have culminated in today’s announcement of an Indicated Mineral Resource of 48.61 million pounds U 3 O 8  at an average grade of 34.5% U 3 O 8 , with the high-grade domain containing nearly 44 million pounds U 3 O 8  at an average grade of 52.1% U 3 O 8 . The team at IsoEnergy is extremely proud of the work done on Hurricane, and it is rewarding to present this initial Resource Estimate to the Company’s stakeholders. \r\n\r\n Hurricane’s exceptionally high uranium grade and relatively shallow depth, together with its proximity to existing eastern Athabasca Basin road, power and milling infrastructure are key attributes.  Saskatchewan is home to the world’s largest and highest-grade uranium mines and deposits, and it is recognized as the premier mining jurisdiction in Canada and one of the best globally. For decades it has also been established as one of the most stable, dependable jurisdictions for the world’s nuclear energy providers to source uranium. Today, the outlook for nuclear energy has never been more positive, with growing recognition of the vital role it will play in providing clean, baseload energy to help address climate change challenges globally. IsoEnergy will continue to progress Hurricane with an objective to meaningfully contribute to the world’s growing demand for clean nuclear energy.”   \r\n\r\n Andy Carmichael, Vice President of Exploration commented: “This Mineral Resource Estimate establishes Hurricane as the world’s newest, very high-grade uranium deposit. On average, one cubic metre of Hurricane’s high-grade domain weighs over 4.5 tonnes and contains over 5,200 lbs of U 3 O 8 . Of the past- and presently- producing uranium mines in the Athabasca Basin, Hurricane is most analogous to the Cigar Lake deposit at the nearby operating mine with respect to the mineralization’s grade, thickness, width, style, and the alteration halo and ground conditions which mantle the deposit. Notably, Hurricane’s Mineral Resource Estimate employs a cut-off grade consistent with uranium Mineral Resource Estimates reported from Cigar Lake and other operations in the eastern Athabasca Basin.” \r\n\r\n Geology and Mineralization \r\n\r\n The Hurricane zone measures 375 metres along strike, up to 125 metres wide, and up to 12 metres thick. The high-grade domain, which contains 43.89 million pounds of U 3 O 8  at an average grade of 52.1% U 3 O 8 , occupies an area 125 metres long and is up to 63 metres wide and up to 4.5 metres thick. Mineralization at Hurricane occurs at the sub-Athabasca unconformity approximately 325 metres vertically below surface and is essentially horizontal. East-west trending, steeply north-dipping basement rocks underlying Hurricane host centimetre- to metre-scale fault zones preferentially occurring at contacts between graphitic and non-graphitic units. Mineralization is controlled by the intersection of these fault zones with the sub-Athabasca unconformity resulting mineralization elongated in its east-west dimension. Mineralization ranges from disseminated to massive and includes very high-grade intersections, including 38.8% over 7.5 metres in LE20-76 between 322.5 and 330 metres which includes a subinterval averaging 74.0% U 3 O 8  over 3.5 metres from 324.0 to 327.5 metres. Additional Hurricane drilling highlights are presented in Table 3, including intercepts from high-grade domain. \r\n\r\n Drilling, Sampling and Analytical \r\n\r\n The Mineral Resource Estimate was defined using 52 diamond drill holes totaling 20,387 metres and using 785 samples. Uranium grade data comprises chemical assays of half split drill core samples collected on site by IsoEnergy staff. All samples were assayed at the independent Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) Geoanalytical Laboratory of Saskatoon, an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited facility. Samples were analysed using a combination of inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and partial or total acid digestion of one aliquot of representative sample pulp per analysis.   Mineralized samples were analysed for U 3 O 8  by ICP-OES.  Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) measures include the field insertion of Certified Reference Material (CRM) standards, CRM blanks, and duplicate samples. The Mineral Resource Estimate grade data was obtained only from chemical assays; no radiometric data were utilized. \r\n\r\n Estimation Methodology \r\n\r\n Mineral Resources were estimated by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. (SLR), an independent consulting company experienced in completing uranium Mineral Resource estimates in the Athabasca Basin and worldwide. \r\n\r\n Wireframe models of mineralized zones were used to constrain the block model grade interpolation process. The models represent grade envelopes using the geological interpretation described above as guidance. The wireframes consisted of Low-Grade (LG), Medium-Grade (MG), and High-Grade (HG) domains at nominal cut-off grades (COG) of 0.05%, 5.0%, and 25.0% U 3 O 8 , respectively (Figures 1 and 2). Sample intervals with assay results less than the nominated COG were included within the mineralized wireframes if the core length was less than two metres or allowed for modelling of grade continuity. Hard domain boundaries were employed to prevent assay results from one domain influencing the remaining domains. \r\n\r\n Statistical evaluation of samples from each domain was completed separately to determine the treatment of high-grade assays. No capping was applied to the High-Grade domain; assays were capped at 5.0% U 3 O 8  and 20.0% U 3 O 8  within the Low- and Medium-Grade domains, respectively. High grade x density threshold value of 250 (approximately equivalent to 55% U 3 O 8 ) spatial restrictions equal to half the parent search ellipse dimensions were utilized within the High-Grade domain. \r\n\r\n The uranium grade was used to estimate the density of each sample using polynomial formula developed by SLR from the results of 115 samples analyzed for bulk density and uranium grade. Densities were then interpolated into the block model to convert mineralized volumes to tonnage and were also used to weight the uranium grades interpolated into each block. \r\n\r\n Blocks were classified as Indicated or Inferred based on drill hole spacing, confidence in the geological interpretation, and apparent continuity of mineralization. All the blocks within the HG domains and blocks within the MG domain with apparent grade continuity from two or more holes were classified as Indicated. For the LG grade domain, blocks that did not meet the criteria of grade x thickness (GT) greater or equal to 1.0%m were removed from the Mineral Resource reporting. The block model was validated using swath plots of composite grades versus inverse distance cubed, ordinary kriging, and nearest neighbour grades in the X, Y, and Z dimensions, volumetric comparison of blocks versus wireframes, visual inspection of block versus composite grades on plan, vertical, and long section, and statistical comparison of block grades and assay composite grades. \r\n\r\n Table 3 – Selected Drilling Results from the Hurricane Deposit  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 1 – Plan view of Mineralized Domains with Selected Drilling Results \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 2 – Cross Section 4435E Showing High-, Medium-, and Low-Grade Domains with Drilling Results   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 3 - IsoEnergy Athabasca Projects  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 4 – Larocque East Property Map \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Qualified Person Statement \r\n\r\n The “Qualified Person” for the Mineral Resource Estimate is Mark B.
