(TSX: ISO) (OTCQX: ISENF) (“IsoEnergy”) and  Purepoint Uranium Group Inc.  (TSXV: PTU) (OTCQB: PTUUF) (“Purepoint”) are pleased to announce the successful implementation of their previously announced joint venture (the “Joint Venture”) (see press release dated October 22, 2024), consolidating 10 uranium projects spanning over 98,000 hectares in the eastern Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan (Figure 1). This strategic collaboration strengthens both companies’ efforts to advance high-potential uranium assets in one of the world’s premier uranium-producing regions. \r\n\r\n The joint venture establishes an initial ownership structure of 60% by IsoEnergy and 40% by Purepoint, with the option to adjust to a 50/50 split through the exercise of put/call options (the “Put/Call Option”) pursuant to which 10% of IsoEnergy’s initial participation interest may be transferred to Purepoint in exchange for 4,000,000 common shares of Purepoint (the “PTU Shares”). The Put/Call Option is exercisable within six months of the Joint Venture’s formation, with the exercise of one option resulting in the expiry of the other. Following completion of the Put/Call Option period, IsoEnergy will hold a further option to purchase an additional 1% interest from Purepoint for $2 million, giving IsoEnergy a 51% participation interest and Purepoint a 49% participation interest. This option expires on the earlier of February 28, 2026, or 60 days after a material uranium discovery. The ownership interests of each company are subject to standard dilution, with any participation interest that is reduced to 10% or less being automatically exchanged for a 2% net smelter royalty (NSR) on the Joint Venture properties. \r\n\r\n The Joint Venture brings together a complementary portfolio of highly prospective properties strategically positioned along the Larocque Trend, a region renowned for high-grade uranium discoveries such as IsoEnergy’s Hurricane Deposit (Figure 2). Subject to the terms of the Joint Venture agreement, Purepoint will serve as operator during the exploration phase, while IsoEnergy will assume operational control as the projects advance to pre-development stages. Work programs across the joint portfolio are expected to commence in the near future. \r\n\r\n Philip Williams, CEO and Director of IsoEnergy, commented, “This partnership allows us to advance a promising portfolio of uranium projects while maintaining our focus on IsoEnergy’s core development assets. By working alongside Purepoint, a highly experienced operator in the Athabasca Basin, we ensure these projects receive the dedicated attention and resources needed to unlock their full potential.” \r\n\r\n Chris Frostad, President and CEO of Purepoint, added, “Our strategy of partnering with the strongest players in the uranium sector ensures that our most prospective projects, like those within this joint venture, are supported by a secure and sustainable source of funding. This collaboration not only validates the potential of these assets but also aligns with our commitment to advance them responsibly and efficiently.” \r\n\r\n Figure 1: Joint Venture Portfolio, including 10 Projects Covering More Than 98,000 Hectares in the Athabasca Basin \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 2: Complimentary and Prospective Ground Covering the Larocque Trend with Strong Discovery Potential  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n * See Qualified Person Statement below. \r\n\r\n Early Warning Disclosure \r\n\r\n In connection with the formation of the Joint Venture, IsoEnergy is deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership of the 4,000,000 PTU Shares issuable upon exercise of the Put/Call Option pursuant to applicable Canadian securities laws.

Following implementation of the Joint Venture, IsoEnergy beneficially owns an aggregate of 7,333,334 PTU Shares and 3,333,334 PTU Warrants, assuming the exercise of the Put/Call Option, representing approximately 11.94% of the issued and outstanding PTU Shares on a non-diluted basis, and approximately 16.48% of the issued and outstanding PTU Shares on a partially diluted basis, assuming the exercise of the PTU Warrants held by IsoEnergy. \r\n\r\n While IsoEnergy currently has no plans or intentions with respect to the Purepoint securities, IsoEnergy may develop such plans or intentions in the future and, at such time, may from time to time acquire additional securities, dispose of some or all of the existing or additional securities or may continue to hold the PTU Shares, PTU Warrants or other securities of Purepoint based on market conditions, general economic and industry conditions, trading prices of Purepoint’s securities, Purepoint’s business, financial condition and prospects and/or other relevant factors. \r\n\r\n A copy of the early warning report to be filed by IsoEnergy will be available under Purepoint’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca or by contacting Graham du Preez, Chief Financial Officer of IsoEnergy, at 306-373-6399.

Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved”. This forward-looking information may relate to the Joint Venture, including statements with respect to the anticipated benefits of the Joint Venture to the parties; the expected ownership interests of IsoEnergy and Purepoint in the Joint Venture; the prospects of each company’s respective projects, including mineralization of each project; the potential for, success of and anticipated timing of commencement of future exploration and development of the Joint Venture projects;   IsoEnergy’s expectations with respect to the sale or purchase or sale of Purepoint securities shares in the future;  and any other activities, events or developments that the companies expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. \r\n\r\n Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management at the time, are inherently subject to business, market and economic risks, uncertainties and contingencies that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of management’s assessment of the effects of the successful completion of the Joint Venture and that the anticipated benefits of the Joint Venture will be realized;   the anticipated mineralization of IsoEnergy’s and Purepoint’s projects being consistent with expectations and the potential benefits from such projects and any upside from such projects;   the price of uranium; that general business and economic conditions will not change in a materially adverse manner; that financing will be available if and when needed and on reasonable terms; and that third party contractors, equipment and supplies and governmental and other approvals required to conduct the Joint Venture’s planned activities will be available on reasonable terms and in a timely manner. Although each of IsoEnergy and Purepoint have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.
