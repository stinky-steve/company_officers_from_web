(“IsoEnergy” or the “Company”) (TSX: ISO; OTCQX: ISENF)  is pleased announce that it has entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “ Agreement ”) with with Future Fuels Inc. (“ Future Fuels ”), pursuant to which the Company has agreed to sell (the “ Transaction ”) to Future Fuels all of its right, title and interest in and to the Mountain Lake property located in Nunavut (the “ Property ” or “ Mountain Lake ”). Future Fuels (TSXV: FTUR) is a publicly traded company that has consolidated a significant land holding in the Hornby Basin, surrounding Mountain Lake (Figure 1). \r\n\r\n Transaction Highlights  \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Establishes a District-Scale Uranium Opportunity by Consolidating the Mountain Lake Property and Hornby Project in the Hornby Basin –  This strategic unification increases discovery potential in the Hornby Basin—one of Canada’s key uranium basins—by combining Mountain Lake’s historic resources with over 40 uranium showings across the expanded land package totalling ~342,000 ha. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Retains Significant Exposure to the Hornby Basin through Accretive Transaction Terms -  IsoEnergy will own a significant equity position in Future Fuels following completion of the transaction and will enter into an investor rights agreement, which ensures continued exposure to the Property's advancement via participation rights in future equity financings, the right to appoint one representative to the Future Fuel board, and net smelter returns (“ NSR ”) royalties. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Unlocks Value from Non-Core Assets in Alignment with IsoEnergy’s Strategic Business Plan –  The Transaction aligns with the Company’s strategy to maximize shareholder value by capitalizing on accretive opportunities and efficiently leveraging non-core assets under favourable market conditions. It also enhances the Company’s planned focus on near-term production, development, and exploration on core jurisdictions, enabling efficient allocation of resources and capital to strengthen core asset value. \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Further Strengthens Equity Portfolio, Now Estimated at C$32.2 Million –  The Transaction is set to further enhance the Company’s equity portfolio 1 , which includes positions in NexGen Energy Ltd., Premier American Uranium Inc., Atha Energy Corp., and Jaguar Uranium Corp. by adding approximately C$4.0 million in additional value. \r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 1: IsoEngery’s Mountain Lake Property, Located within Future Fuels Hornby Project 1 \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n For additional information regarding the Mountain Lake project, please refer to the Technical report entitled \"Mountain Lake Property Nunavut\" dated February 15, 2005 reported by Triex Mineral Corporation. \r\n\r\n This estimate is a “historical estimate” as defined under NI 43-101 (as defined herein).
