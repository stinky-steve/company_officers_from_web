(“  CUR  ” or the “  Company  ”) (TSXV: CUR) (OTCQB: CURUF) is pleased to announce that further to its press release on October 18, 2021 regarding the creation and planned spin-out (the “  Spin-Out  ”) of Labrador Uranium Inc. (“  Labrador Uranium  ” or “  LUR  ”), LUR has completed its previously announced fully marketed private placement (the “  LUR  Offering  ”) for gross proceeds of C$8,000,000 from the sale of 11,428,571 subscription receipts of LUR (each, a “  Subscription Receipt  ”) at a price of C$0.70 per Subscription Receipt (the “  Offering Price  ”). Red Cloud Securities Inc. acted as lead agent and sole bookrunner on behalf of a syndicate of agents including Haywood Securities Inc. and PI Financial Corp. (collectively, the “  Agents  ”) under the LUR Offering. \r\n\r\n Each Subscription Receipt entitles the holder thereof to automatically receive, upon satisfaction of certain escrow release conditions (the “  Escrow Release Conditions  ”), one unit of LUR (a “  Unit  ”). Each Unit shall be comprised of one class B common share of LUR (each, a “  Unit Share  ”) and one-half of one common share purchase warrant of LUR (each whole warrant, a “  Warrant  ”). Each Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one class B common share of LUR (each, a “  Warrant Share  ”) at a price of C$1.05 for a period of 24 months following the Escrow Release Date (as defined herein). The Escrow Release Conditions includes the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the completion of the Spin-Out as well as receipt of conditional approval for the listing of LUR’s class B common shares (the “  Common Shares  ”) on the Canadian Securities Exchange (the “  Listing  ”). \r\n\r\n The proceeds of the LUR Offering, net of 50% of the cash commission payable to the Agents and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents, will be held in escrow and not released to LUR unless the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied on or before February 28, 2022 (the date of satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions being, the “  Escrow Release Date  ”). Following the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the net proceeds of the LUR Offering are expected to be used to fund the proposed exploration programs for the Moran Lake Project, the Central Mineral Belt Project and the Notakwanon Project as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. \r\n\r\n In addition, LUR issued to 799,999 warrants (the “  Broker Warrants  ”) to the Agents. Each Broker Warrant is exercisable to acquire one Common Share at a price of C$0.70 for a period of 24 months following the closing of the LUR Offering. \r\n\r\n This news release does not constitute an offer of securities for sale in the United States.

(TSXV: CUR) (OTCQB: CURUF) was created in early 2020 to capitalize on an anticipated uranium market resurgence using the proven model of diversified project consolidation. To date, the Company has acquired or has the right to acquire uranium projects in Australia, Canada, Argentina, and the United States each with significant past expenditures and attractive characteristics for development. Most recently, the Company completed a transformational strategic acquisition and alliance with Energy Fuels Inc., a leading U.S.-based uranium mining company, and acquired a portfolio of permitted, past-producing conventional uranium and vanadium mines in Utah and Colorado. These mines are currently on stand-by, ready for rapid restart as market conditions permit, positioning CUR as a near-term uranium producer. \r\n \r\n For More Information, Please Contact \r\n\r\n Philip Williams \r\n President and CEO \r\n pwilliams@consolidateduranium.com \r\n\r\n Mars Investor Relations \r\n+1 647 557 6640 \r\n cur@marsinvestorrelations.com \r\n\r\n Twitter: @ConsolidatedUr \r\n www.consolidateduranium.com \r\n\r\n Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulations Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. \r\n\r\n Cautionary Statement Regarding “Forward-Looking” Information \r\n\r\n This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. “Forward-looking information” includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions; the Listing; the use of proceeds from the LUR Offering and activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future.
