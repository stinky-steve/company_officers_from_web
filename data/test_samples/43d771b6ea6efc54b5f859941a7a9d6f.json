(“ IsoEnergy ” or the “ Company ”) ( TSXV: ISO; OTCQX: ISENF ) is pleased to announce that exploration plans have been finalized for the winter 2023 season. \r\n\r\n Highlights: \r\n\r\n \r\n\t Diamond drilling at Larocque East and Hawk totalling 6800m in 12 drill holes \r\n\t Ground geophysical surveys at Larocque East and Geiger \r\n \r\n\r\n Tim Gabruch, President and Chief Executive Officer commented: “This winter, IsoEnergy will continue to explore its diverse portfolio of prospective projects. The team is mobilizing now, and diamond drilling at Larocque East will follow-up on the encouraging basement alteration zone intersected in the summer of 2022. IsoEnergy will also complete its first drill program at the Hawk Project, which covers 10 km of a highly underexplored conductive trend in the infrastructure-rich eastern Athabasca Basin. Geophysical programs at Larocque East and Geiger will generate and refine drill targets, ensuring a steady stream of exploration for several seasons to come. Having recently completed our $18.3 million financing in December, IsoEnergy is well positioned to undertake this exciting exploration program and development work at a time when the nuclear industry and the uranium sector in particular looks incredibly strong as we move into 2023 and beyond.” \r\n\r\n Larocque East Project \r\n\r\n Six diamond drill holes totalling 2000 m are planned at Larocque East to follow up favourable results on the eastern Kernaghan Trend. The 3.5 km of this conductive trend covered by the Larocque East project has only been drilled on a single fence, where historical drilling intersected anomalous uranium geochemistry and chlorite in the lower sandstone and defined over 40 m of unconformity relief on section. Following up the historical results, IsoEnergy’s summer 2022 drill hole LE22-144 intersected a broad zone of illitic and hematitic alteration associated with a basement-hosted structure. The structure and alteration are located in the 265 m gap between the historical drill holes. Winter 2023 drilling is planned as a series of systematic step outs along strike of LE22-144 to evaluate the extent of the alteration zone and test for the presence of mineralization. Figure 2 shows the planned drill hole locations. \r\n\r\n Two lines of ground electromagnetic (EM) surveying are planned along the approximately 15 km long interpreted western extension of the Kernaghan Trend. This work will generate drill targets for first-pass evaluation of this undrilled portion of the Kernaghan Trend. Figure 2 shows the survey line locations. \r\n\r\n Hawk Project Diamond Drilling \r\n\r\n Six diamond drill holes, totalling 4800 m, are planned at IsoEnergy’s Hawk project during the winter 2023 season. Drilling will follow-up results from the 2022 EM survey which identified multiple moderate to strong basement conductors in each of the three surveyed areas. Winter 2023 drilling will consist of \r\nfirst-pass testing of each area to assess for the presence of significant alteration, structure, and geochemistry. Figure 3 shows the planned drill hole locations. \r\n\r\n Hawk is interpreted to cover at least 10 km of prospective conductive strike with depths to the unconformity interpreted to be between 600 and 750 metres. The single historical drill hole completed within the project, OR11-06, failed to intersect conductive basement; therefore, the prospective stratigraphy is considered to remain untested. Relogging of OR11-06 in 2022 by IsoEnergy identified pervasively bleached and locally desilicified lower sandstones above pervasively sericitized basement, which is suggestive of hydrothermal alteration in the vicinity. \r\n\r\n Geiger Project Geophysics \r\n\r\n A ground EM survey is planned at Geiger to follow-up a trend of anomalous drilling results and generate additional drill targets along strike of weak historical mineralization. IsoEnergy’s summer 2022 drill hole GG22-31 intersected a zone of pervasive argillic alteration extending 55 metres into the basement associated with graphitic gneisses. Located 1.7 km along strike to the north of GG22-31, historical drill hole Q23-003 intersected a zone of basement alteration similar to that in GG22-31. A further 2.8 km north, Fission 3.0 Corp.’s drill hole ML22-006 is reported to have intersected basement-hosted radioactivity associated with graphitic fault structures. These anomalous results are interpreted to occur along a 4.5 km long trend of which 3.4 km lies within the Geiger project. Importantly, only GG22-31 and ML22-006 are interpreted to have intersected the targeted conductors, leaving the remainder of this trend inadequately tested. \r\n\r\n A ground EM survey is also planned north of historical drill hole Q24-001 which intersected 0.11% U 3 O 8  over 0.3 m (259.6 – 259.9m) at the unconformity within an alteration zone spanning the unconformity. Q24-001 was followed up on section and along strike to the south but remains open to the north. \r\n\r\n Figure 4 shows the planned Geiger survey areas. \r\n\r\n Figure 1 – Athabasca Property Map \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 2 – Larocque East Planned Drilling and Geophysics \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 3 – Hawk Project Planned Drilling Areas \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Figure 4 – Geiger Project Ground Geophysical Survey Areas \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Qualified Person Statement \r\n\r\n David Thomas, P.Geo., IsoEnergy’s Technical Advisor, is the “Qualified Person” (as defined in  NI 43-101 –  Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects ) for the Company and has validated and approved the technical and scientific content of this news release.
