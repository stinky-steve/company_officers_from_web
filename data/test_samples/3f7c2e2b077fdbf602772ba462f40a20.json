According to Surge, it is now the largest and highest grade lithium deposit in the United States with an insitu value of $116 billion, surpassing Lithium America’s (TSX:LAC) Thacker Pass, and it is a lakebed clay-hosted deposit.  <Link to press release> \n September 17, 2024 – Peloton announced the interim findings of its Summer Exploration Program at NELP – Geologic mapping suggests the Target Area sampled at surface is likely higher in the stratigraphy than the lithium clay layers identified on Surge’s property beside NELP, and that drilling is warranted to test the potential of clay layers below surface .  <Link to press release> \n Additionally, a cross-section published by Surge in its July 23, 2024 press release shows the clay layers dipping toward NELP, and projects those layers to within 1.0 to 1.5 kilometers of NELP  \n Peloton is a direct neighbour of Surge and has defined a similar geological environment with anomolous lithium values over large areas of known lakebed. Peloton’s contrinuing exploration programs are designed to outline potential deposits in this material \n \n Recent analyst price targets for Surge of $1.50 per share to $3.90 per share equate to a potential marketcap of $248.5 million to $643.5 million  (Research Reports from SCP Resource Finance and Roth Capital Partners are linked below)  & Lithium Americas has a marketcap of $795 million.  Peloton has a current marketcap of $13.7 million. \n \n \n \n \n \n Link to Roth Capital Partners research report on Surge, September 25, 2024 \n \n Link to SCP Resource Finance research report on Surge, September 24, 2024 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t \n\t\t \n      \n    \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t RECENT POSTS \n\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t March 5, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\t Video:  Peloton Minerals CEO shares prep details for Nevada Lithium drilling at PDAC conference \n\t\t\t\t\t Read the Story \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t February 25, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\t IBK Capital Corp. – Peloton Minerals Corporate Update \n\t\t\t\t\t Read the Story \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t January 29, 2025 \n\t\t\t\t\t IBK Capital Corp. – Lithium Overview – An Insight On Deposit Types & Extraction Methods \n\t\t\t\t\t Read the Story \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n     \n      \n       \n\t\t Back to the Blog \t\n       \n      \n\n       \n      \n", "markdown_content": ""}
