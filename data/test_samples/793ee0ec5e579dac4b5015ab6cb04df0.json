Shareholders urged to vote prior to the proxy voting deadline of Friday, December 11, 2020 at 9:30 a.m. (Saskatoon Time) \n \nNot for distribution to U.S. news wire services or dissemination in the United States. \n SASKATOON, SK (CNW- December 9, 2020)  – Karnalyte Resources Inc. ( “Karnalyte”  or the  “Company” ) (TSX: KRN) today announced that leading independent proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ( “ISS” ) recommends that Karnalyte shareholders vote AGAINST the removal of current Directors and WITHHOLD from voting for the slate of Dissident nominees in relation to the Company’s upcoming Special Meeting of Shareholders (the  “Meeting” ). \n In making its recommendation, ISS carefully and independently reviewed the arguments made by both sides. In making its recommendation, ISS stated:  \n “The dissident has failed to make a compelling case that a change in board control is warranted…As such, shareholders are advised to vote AGAINST the removal of the current directors and to vote WITHHOLD for the slate of dissident nominees.” \n “The voting recommendations from ISS against the removal of the current Board and to withhold from the Dissident’s nominees reinforces that changes to our board are not warranted and that it is in Karnalyte’s best interest to move ahead with its existing board members,” said Danielle Favreau, Karnalyte’s Interim CEO. “Time is short. In order to ensure that your votes are received in time to be counted at the Meeting, shareholders should vote immediately and as recommended by our Board and ISS to put this matter behind us.” \n \nVOTE YOUR BLUE MANAGEMENT PROXY FORM TODAY \n Karnalyte’s Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote as follows using only the BLUE MANAGMENT PROXY FORM: \n 1.\tAGAINST the Directors Removal Resolution; \n2.\tWITHHOLD from the Dissident Director Nominees (as described in the Management Information Circular). \n The Special Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled for Tuesday, December 15, 2020 but given the COVID-19 pandemic, shareholders are strongly encouraged not to attend the meeting in person. Instead, in order to ensure your vote is counted, shareholders are urged to vote in advance and ensure that your vote is received prior to the proxy voting deadline of Friday, December 11, 2020 at 9:30 a.m. (Saskatoon Time).
