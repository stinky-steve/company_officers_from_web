(“CUR”, the “Company”, “Consolidated Uranium”) (TSXV: CUR) (OTCQX: CURUF)  is pleased to announce it has obtained a final order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) approving the previously announced spin-out of Premier American Uranium Inc. (“PUR”) through a plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Spin-Out”).  \r\n\r\n Receipt of the final order follows CUR’s annual and general special meeting of shareholders held on August 3, 2023 (the “Meeting”), where the Spin-Out was overwhelmingly approved by 99% of the votes cast by shareholders. All other matters put before the Meeting were approved by shareholders, including the re-election of each of the director nominees, Philip Williams, Anthony Milewski, Mark Raguz, John Jentz and Mark Chalmers, re-appointment of McGovern Hurley LLP, Chartered Professional Accountants as auditors of the Company and re-approval of the Company’s Omnibus Long Term Incentive Plan. \r\n\r\n On May 24, 2023, CUR and PUR entered into an arrangement agreement pursuant to which the parties agreed to effect the proposed Spin-Out of PUR, currently a majority-controlled subsidiary of CUR. If completed, the Spin-Out will result in, among other things, CUR transferring ownership of certain indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries which hold eight U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) leases and certain patented claims located in Colorado (the “CUR Assets”) to PUR in exchange for 7,753,752 common shares of PUR (“PUR Shares”), a portion of which will be distributed to the Company’s shareholders on a pro rata basis pursuant to the provisions of the plan of arrangement.  \r\n\r\n CUR shareholders must hold their CUR common shares until 12:01 am (Toronto time) on the effective date of the Spin-Out (the “Effective Date”) in order to receive their pro rata portion of the PUR Shares being distributed pursuant to the Spin-Out. CUR will disseminate a press release five business days in advance of the Effective Date once all of the conditions to closing of the Spin-Out have been satisfied in accordance with the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange in order to notify CUR shareholders of the record date for purposes of the distribution pursuant to the Spin-Out. \r\n\r\n About Consolidated Uranium   \r\n\r\n Consolidated Uranium Inc. (TSXV: CUR) (OTCQX: CURUF) was created in early 2020 to capitalize on an anticipated uranium market resurgence using the proven model of diversified project consolidation. To date, the Company has acquired or has the right to acquire uranium projects in Australia, Canada, Argentina, and the United States each with significant past expenditures and attractive characteristics for development.  \r\n\r\n The Company is currently advancing its portfolio of permitted, past-producing conventional uranium and vanadium mines in Utah and Colorado, with a toll milling arrangement in place with Energy Fuels Inc., a leading U.S.-based uranium mining company. These mines are currently on stand-by, ready for rapid restart as market conditions permit, positioning CUR as a near-term uranium producer.  \r\n\r\n For More Information, Please Contact: \r\n\r\n Philip Williams \r\nChairman and CEO \r\npwilliams@consolidateduranium.com \r\n\r\n Toll-Free: 1-833-572-2333 \r\nTwitter: @ConsolidatedUr  \r\nwww.consolidateduranium.com  \r\n\r\n Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulations Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. \r\n\r\n Cautionary Statement Regarding “Forward-Looking” Information \r\n\r\n This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. “Forward-looking information” includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future including, but not limited to, completion of the Spin-Out and the Company’s ongoing business plan, sampling, exploration and work programs.
