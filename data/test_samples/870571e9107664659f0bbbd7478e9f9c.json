Golden Trail is 100% owned, with no royalties outstanding, and is comprised of an 909 acre claim package.  Golden Trail is a gold – silver exploration prospect, and has recently been shown to be prospective for lithium with hectorite and illitic clays having been identified on the property. The Golden Trail is now also part of the  Northern Nevada Lithium Project . \n Extensive surface exploration has identified Carlin style alteration and many geologic similarities to Long Canyon. The largest identified gold vein at surface, the Golden Trail Vein (“GTV”), is over 1,200 meters long and has an associated alteration zone that averages 30 meters wide.  Over 900 grab samples have been taken along the GTV assaying from anomalous to 28 grams gold, and continuous 5 foot trench samples returned 13.7 grams gold per ton “g/t” with 36.2 g/t silver in one 5 foot trench, and 3.49 g/t gold with 105 g/t silver in a second 5 foot trench. \n A major gravity anomaly underlies Golden Trail as shown on the map below. This is derived from a regional USGS survey and the gravity anomaly is interpreted by the USGS to be a shallow pluton or magmatic intrusion. A more recent detailed Peloton gravity survey shows a change in gradient along the western boundary of the NW striking gravity anomaly and a series of coincident surface hydrothermal alteration anomalies have been identified through hyperspectral airborne and surface technology and geochemical sampling. These anomalies occur in the hanging wall of NW striking and NE dipping high-angle normal faults, are high in ammonia illite and alumina illite which are often associated with Carlin-style deposits, and geochemistry shows elevated pathfinder elements and gold mineralization. \n 2020-21 –  The Company drilled 2,400 feet of reverse circulation drilling to test coincident anomlies shown in red dots on the map below. The anomalies drilled in this program are coincident, in that geology, mineralogy, geochemistry and geophysics intersect to suggest these targets. In mid-June, 2021 the Company confirmed that these hydrothermal alteration anomalies extend to at least a vertical depth of 195 feet, with high temperature hydrothermal alteration minerals intersected in all of the drill holes as well anomalous gold, silver (average 0.98 g/t; range 0.08 to 8.52 g/t; 420 analyses) and pathfinder elements. \n The next step will be to conduct two deep-penetrating geophysical programs to try to image the source of the mineralizing fluids and to plan a deeper drilling program in this area. \n The large pink area above represents a major gravity anomaly that underlies the Golden Trail Project, which is interpreted as a magmatic intrusion. The red and greed “dotted” areas are surface Carlin style hydro thermal anomalies (aluminum illite and ammonio-illite alteration). \n 2019  – An initial drill program was conducted in late 2019 above 3,000 feet north of the coincident anomalies being drilled in 2020. The initial 2019 program consisted of 11 holes to a vertical depth of 65 feet and over a strike length of 300 feet and encountered detectable gold and silver values, or higher, in 82% of the tested footage. Assays ranged from 0.005 g/t Au to 0.095 g/t Au and from 0.5 g/t Ag to 74.8 g/t Ag. All holes were drilled at 45 degrees for about 110 feet core length, and all holes bottomed in mineralization. This mineralized zone remains open in all directions along strike in both directions, width and at depth. \n 2019 Drill Holes from 5 drill pads established a mineralized strike length of 300 feet to a vertical depth of 65 feet and open in all directions. \n \n Golden Trail was a featured project at the 2015 Geologic Society of Nevada (GSN) Symposium \n Permitting:  Golden Trail has a drilling permit in place, issued by the Bureau of Land Management, which was recently amended to enable drilling of the coincident hyrdrothermal alteration anomalies shown above. This permit is valid until January 31, 2022. \n Richard C.
