ANNOUNCES 2022 YEAR END RESULTS AND PROVIDES CORPORATE UPDATE \n      KRN Admin  March 28, 2023     \n\n\n \n\n\n   \n \n \n                 March 28, 2023   —   Not for distribution to U.S. news wire services or dissemination in the United States. \n SASKATOON, SK (CNW- March 28, 2023) –  Karnalyte Resources Inc. (“ Karnalyte ” or the “ Company “) (TSX: KRN) today announced its financial results and corporate highlights for the financial year ended December 31, 2022. \n 2022 – YEAR IN REVIEW \n In 2022, Karnalyte commenced an update to its NI 43-101 Compliant Technical Report, successfully raised capital by way of a rights offering, and prepared an ESG Strategy Report. \n POTASH – WYNYARD POTASH PROJECT \n Market Update –  The market conditions for potash stayed strong in 2022 although softening slightly toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 and to date. Major geopolitical events including the Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in unprecedented supply chain disruption for many commodities and especially for potash. It is expected that these conditions will persist into 2023 and likely beyond. \n UPDATE TO THE NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 COMPLIANT TECHNICAL REPORT \n In January of 2022, the Company announced the appointment of Wood PLC (“ Wood ”), a leading global consulting and engineering company, as lead author of an update to its NI 43-101 compliant technical report (“ Technical Report ” or “ Report ”). Wood was appointed after a significant improvement in the market conditions for potash which began in 2021 and continued through 2022. \n Karnalyte has made diligent progress on this important step toward construction of its Wynyard Potash Project, despite unforeseen challenges that have resulted in delays. \n Wood provided Karnalyte with preliminary capital cost and operating cost estimates using budgetary pricing for mechanical equipment, mechanical bulks, and tanks that take into account the changes to Saskatchewan’s tax regime, currency exchange rates and cost of labour. Karnalyte has been reviewing these capital and operating cost quotes, along with exploring various price assumptions while Wood works toward the finalization of a financial model and final compilation of the report, expected soon. \n The recent increase in potash prices and other commodity prices has resulted in significant growth in Western Canada’s economic activity, and this, in conjunction with supply chain constraints impacting suppliers worldwide is, among other factors, causing delays to the update to the Technical Report. In conjunction with the update Karnalyte is also investigating certain capital cost efficiencies, opportunities to enhance sustainability and working towards getting more comfort on the assumptions used given the current market and economic conditions.  Karnalyte will provide a further update as appropriate once the Technical Report is finalized. \n “Karnalyte continues to focus on advancing the update to the NI 43-101 Compliant Technical Report and has continued making steady progress, despite challenges the mining industry is facing beyond our control and the Company’s desire to move forward in a responsible way.” said Danielle Favreau, interim Chief Executive Officer of Karnalyte. “The Company remains committed to following best practices as we work through this critical step, which will serve as a strong foundation for our Wynyard Potash Project.” \n To date, Karnalyte has achieved a number of key milestones in relation to the update to the Report. This includes engaging industry leading solution mining and engineering firm ERCOSPLAN ingenieurgesellschaft Geotechnik und Bergbau mbH (“ ERCOSPLAN ”), which provided Karnalyte with a positive review of core samples, and confirmation from Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Environment that Karnalyte’s previous Environmental Impact Study approval from 2013 remains valid. \n NITROGEN – THE PROTEOS NITROGEN PROJECT \n The Proteos Nitrogen Project remains under consideration as part of Karnalyte’s future and may diversify our business by adding a second fertilizer product line. The Proteos Nitrogen Project is a proposed regional-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant to be located in central Saskatchewan, with a nameplate capacity of 700 metric tonnes per day (“mtpd”) ammonia and 1,200 mtpd urea. Our primary target market is local, independent wholesalers within a ~400-kilometre radius of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, with a secondary target market of Midwest USA wholesalers near the Canadian border. There were no significant developments to report on this project in 2022. \n RIGHTS OFFERING \n On June 22, 2022, the Company announced the launch of a rights offering (the “ Rights Offering ”) as part of its capital raise strategy in order to provide a viable and attractive investment opportunity for existing shareholders. On August 3rd, the Company announced the successful completion of this Rights Offering, following its expiry on July 29, 2022, raising a total of $3,862,000 in proceeds as additional capital for, among other things, the development of the Potash Project. \n Karnalyte was pleased to announce the participation of Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (“ GSFC ”) in the Rights Offering, a major agriculture sector business in India, providing additional investment in Karnalyte and further demonstrating its ongoing commitment and support for the Company and the Potash Project. \n ESG STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT \n In line with Karnalyte’s environmental advantages and governance advancements, the Company engaged with Karri Howlett Consulting Inc. (“ Karri Howlett Consulting ” or “ KHCI ”) in the year to prepare an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ ESG ”) strategy report. In October 2022, Karnalyte received a first draft of the report analyzing key focus areas per Karnalyte stakeholders, with practical recommendations under each of the Environmental, Social and Governance categories. \n Karnalyte is in the process of reviewing the recommendations as it seeks to enhance its existing policies and practices, ensuring the Company is up to date and in line with current and peer ESG trends. Karnalyte maintains its ultimate goal of operating the business in the best interests of shareholders and relevant stakeholders to further strengthen its strategic position in the potash sector. \n OUTLOOK FOR 2023 \n In 2023, the Company plans to complete the update to its NI 43-101 technical report, to continue to work on identifying cost efficiencies, optimizing construction and operation plans, and enhancing project sustainability, and to increase business development activities to seek out and attract investment and strategic partners to move one or both of the Company’s projects forward to development. \n 2022 YEAR END RESULTS AND SELECTED ANNUAL INFORMATION \n During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s focus was on updating its NI 43-101 Compliant Technical Report, the successful raising of capital by way of a rights offering, and the preparation of an ESG Strategy Report. On December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $3.7 million, a positive working capital of $3.6 million, and no debt. \n The following information has been summarised from the Company’s audited financial statements. Karnalyte’s 2022-year end financial statements, management’s discussion and analysis, and annual information form are available at www.sedar.com or on the Company’s website at www.karnalyte.com. \n \n ABOUT KARNALYTE RESOURCES INC. \n Karnalyte Resources Inc. is a development stage company focused on two fertilizer products, potash and nitrogen, to be produced and manufactured in Saskatchewan.

Karnalyte is also exploring the development of the Proteos Nitrogen Project, which is a proposed small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant with a nameplate production capacity of approximately 700 metric tonnes per day (“ MTPD ”) of ammonia and approximately 1,200 MTPD of urea, and a target customer market of independent fertilizer wholesalers in Central Saskatchewan. \n ABOUT THE WYNYARD POTASH PROJECT \n The Wynyard Potash Project is a construction ready solution mining potash project located in Wynyard, Saskatchewan, with planned phase 1 production of 625,000 TPY of high grade granular potash, and two subsequent phases of 750,000 TPY each, taking total production up to 2.125 million TPY. All environmental permits remain valid, preliminary detailed engineering is complete, and the existing offtake agreement with Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited remains in effect.
