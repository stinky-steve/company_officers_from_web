 Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. There is no certainty that Mineral Resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves. 
 The Inferred Mineral Resource in this estimate has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration. 
 The Mineral Resources in this news release were estimated in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the âCIMâ) Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Definitions (2014) and Best Practices Guidelines (2019) prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council, as may be amended from time to time. 
 A silver price of US$21/oz with a process recovery of 89%, a gold price of US$1,900/oz with a process recovery of 85%, a zinc price of US$1.20/lb with a process recovery of 72%, a lead price of US$1.00/lb with a process recovery of 85%, and a copper price of US$4.00/lb with a process recovery of 75% were used in establishing the MRE.

 The constraining pit optimization parameters were US$3/t for mineralized material mining, US$2/t for waste mining, US$89/t for processing and US$6/t for G&A totalling US$95/t for a cut-off and 50-degree pit slopes. 
 The out-of-pit parameters used a US$30/t mining cost, US$90/t processing cost and US$6/t G&A totalling US$125/t for a cut-off.. The out-of-pit Mineral Resource grade blocks were quantified above the $125 NSR cut-off, below the constraining pit shell and within the constraining mineralized wireframes. Outâof-pit Mineral Resources exhibit continuity and reasonable potential for extraction by the long hole underground mining method. 
 Individual calculations in tables and totals may not sum due to rounding of original numbers. 
 Grade capping of 800Â g/t Ag, 30Â g/t Au, 28% Zn, 10% Pb and 1.4%Â Cu was applied to composites before grade estimation. 
 Bulk density was evaluated separately for each individual vein with values ranging from 3.20 to 4.00 t/m 3  determined from drill core samples and used for the MRE. For oxidized and transitional material, a bulk density of 2.65 t/m 3  was used. 
 1.0m composites were used during grade estimation.

 The Mineral Reserve is estimated in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions (2014) and Best Practices Guidelines (2019) prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council. 
 The Mineral Reserve is estimated with a variable COG which was calculated by mining method. 
 Ag content (oz) is estimated as in-situ. 
 An ONHYM royalty of 3% is included in the Mineral Reserve Estimate. 
 The Mineral Reserve is estimated with a mining recovery of 95%. 
 The Mineral Reserve includes both internal and external dilution. The external dilution included a mining dilution of 0.3 m width on the hanging wall and footwall for the long-hole mining method and a 0.1 m width on the hanging wall and footwall for the cut-and-fill mining methods. 
 A minimum mining width of 4m was used for the long hole and cut-and-fill mining methods. 
 The economic viability of the Mineral Reserve has been demonstrated. 
 For the historical tailings Reserves Estimate, a silver price of US$20/oz with a process recovery of 92%, a process cost of $20.93/t (including G&A), and a mining cost of $4.31/t (including haulage) were used. 
 For the Open-pit Reserves Estimate, a silver price of US$20/oz with a process recovery of 92%, a process cost of US$22.91/t (including G&A), and a mining cost of $4.00/t (including haulage) were used. 
 For the Underground Reserves Estimate, a silver price of $20/oz with a process recovery of 92%, a process cost of US$22.91/t (including G&A), and a mining cost of $24.13/t (including haulage and backfill) were used for the combined cut-and-fill and long-hole methods. 
 The reserves estimate has an effective date of December 13, 2021. 
 Totals may not add due to rounding.

 A silver price of US$22.5/oz with a process recovery of 90%, US$20/t rock process cost, US$16.5/t tailings process cost and US$7/t G&A cost were used. 
 The constraining pit optimization parameters were US$15/t of mineralized material (including waste mining) and 50-degree pit slopes with a 65 g/t Ag cut-off. 
 The out-of-pit parameters used a US$22/t mining cost. The out-of-pit Mineral Resource grade blocks were quantified above the 75 g/t Ag cut-off, below the constraining pit shell and within the constraining mineralized wireframes. Outâof-pit Mineral Resources exhibit continuity and reasonable potential for extraction by the cut and fill underground mining method. 
 The historical tailings parameters were at a US$9/t mining cost, and Mineral Resource grade blocks were quantified above the 50 g/t Ag cut-off. 
 Individual calculations in tables and totals may not sum correctly due to rounding of original numbers. 
 Grade capping of 6,000 g/t Ag was applied to composites before grade estimation. 
 A bulk density value of 2.77 t/m3 was determined from core samples and used for the Mineral Resource Estimate. 
 1.2m composites were used during grade estimation. 
 Previously mined areas of the deposit were depleted from the mineral resource estimate.

 Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. There is no certainty that Mineral Resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves. 
 The Inferred Mineral Resource in this estimate has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration. 
 The Mineral Resources in this news release were estimated in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the âCIMâ) Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Definitions (2014) and Best Practices Guidelines (2019) prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council, as may be amended from time to time. 
 A silver price of US$21/oz with a process recovery of 89%, a gold price of US$1,900/oz with a process recovery of 85%, a zinc price of US$1.20/lb with a process recovery of 72%, a lead price of US$1.00/lb with a process recovery of 85%, and a copper price of US$4.00/lb with a process recovery of 75% were used in establishing the MRE.

 The constraining pit optimization parameters were US$3/t for mineralized material mining, US$2/t for waste mining, US$89/t for processing and US$6/t for G&A totalling US$95/t for a cut-off and 50-degree pit slopes. 
 The out-of-pit parameters used a US$30/t mining cost, US$90/t processing cost and US$6/t G&A totalling US$125/t for a cut-off.. The out-of-pit Mineral Resource grade blocks were quantified above the $125 NSR cut-off, below the constraining pit shell and within the constraining mineralized wireframes. Outâof-pit Mineral Resources exhibit continuity and reasonable potential for extraction by the long hole underground mining method. 
 Individual calculations in tables and totals may not sum due to rounding of original numbers. 
 Grade capping of 800Â g/t Ag, 30Â g/t Au, 28% Zn, 10% Pb and 1.4%Â Cu was applied to composites before grade estimation. 
 Bulk density was evaluated separately for each individual vein with values ranging from 3.20 to 4.00 t/m 3  determined from drill core samples and used for the MRE. For oxidized and transitional material, a bulk density of 2.65 t/m 3  was used. 
 1.0m composites were used during grade estimation.

 The Mineral Reserve is estimated in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions (2014) and Best Practices Guidelines (2019) prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council. 
 The Mineral Reserve is estimated with a variable COG which was calculated by mining method. 
 Ag content (oz) is estimated as in-situ. 
 An ONHYM royalty of 3% is included in the Mineral Reserve Estimate. 
 The Mineral Reserve is estimated with a mining recovery of 95%. 
 The Mineral Reserve includes both internal and external dilution. The external dilution included a mining dilution of 0.3 m width on the hanging wall and footwall for the long-hole mining method and a 0.1 m width on the hanging wall and footwall for the cut-and-fill mining methods. 
 A minimum mining width of 4m was used for the long hole and cut-and-fill mining methods. 
 The economic viability of the Mineral Reserve has been demonstrated. 
 For the historical tailings Reserves Estimate, a silver price of US$20/oz with a process recovery of 92%, a process cost of $20.93/t (including G&A), and a mining cost of $4.31/t (including haulage) were used. 
 For the Open-pit Reserves Estimate, a silver price of US$20/oz with a process recovery of 92%, a process cost of US$22.91/t (including G&A), and a mining cost of $4.00/t (including haulage) were used. 
 For the Underground Reserves Estimate, a silver price of $20/oz with a process recovery of 92%, a process cost of US$22.91/t (including G&A), and a mining cost of $24.13/t (including haulage and backfill) were used for the combined cut-and-fill and long-hole methods. 
 The reserves estimate has an effective date of December 13, 2021. 
 Totals may not add due to rounding.

 A silver price of US$22.5/oz with a process recovery of 90%, US$20/t rock process cost, US$16.5/t tailings process cost and US$7/t G&A cost were used. 
 The constraining pit optimization parameters were US$15/t of mineralized material (including waste mining) and 50-degree pit slopes with a 65 g/t Ag cut-off. 
 The out-of-pit parameters used a US$22/t mining cost. The out-of-pit Mineral Resource grade blocks were quantified above the 75 g/t Ag cut-off, below the constraining pit shell and within the constraining mineralized wireframes. Outâof-pit Mineral Resources exhibit continuity and reasonable potential for extraction by the cut and fill underground mining method. 
 The historical tailings parameters were at a US$9/t mining cost, and Mineral Resource grade blocks were quantified above the 50 g/t Ag cut-off. 
 Individual calculations in tables and totals may not sum correctly due to rounding of original numbers. 
 Grade capping of 6,000 g/t Ag was applied to composites before grade estimation. 
 A bulk density value of 2.77 t/m3 was determined from core samples and used for the Mineral Resource Estimate. 
 1.2m composites were used during grade estimation. 
 Previously mined areas of the deposit were depleted from the mineral resource estimate.
