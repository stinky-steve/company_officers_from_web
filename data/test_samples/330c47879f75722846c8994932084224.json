Dave is very well-known globally as a leading expert on uranium geology, with particular expertise in Saskatchewan’s Athabasca Basin. We are thrilled that Dave is joining IsoEnergy at this stage to assist on all uranium-related matters, on an exclusive basis. With more than four decades of experience, Dave’s knowledge and expertise in this area are second to none. \r\n\r\n We are also very pleased to announce the promotion of Andy to Vice President, Exploration. Andy has been an invaluable contributor to all aspects of IsoEnergy’s exploration programs since the inception of the Company in 2016 and has played a significant role in putting together the current land package and contributed to the strategy that ultimately led to the discovery of the Hurricane zone. Having Dave and Andy on board will be instrumental to the Company going forward and combined with NexGen’s ongoing support of our geological programs, IsoEnergy is well positioned for continued exploration success. \r\n\r\n Additionally, IsoEnergy is very happy to add Elizabeth Williamson as Corporate Secretary. Elizabeth has many years of governance experience, including working with Cameco Corporation, where from 2005 to 2013 her focus was on governance compliance and supporting its Board of Directors. Both Dave and Elizabeth are based in Saskatoon, SK, which builds on IsoEnergy’s objective to reposition leadership of the Company to Saskatchewan – home of our exceptional assets, including the high-grade Hurricane discovery.” \r\n\r\n Dave Thomas stated: “I have watched IsoEnergy with keen interest over the past few years. The Company has a top tier land package and its exploration approach, resulting in the discovery of the Hurricane zone, has elevated the Company to a unique position among some of the top uranium companies. I am excited about the prospects ahead for the Company and look forward to providing my experience and expertise to the Board and the entire IsoEnergy team.” \r\n\r\n Andy Carmichael, Vice President of Exploration commented: “Contributing to IsoEnergy’s success has been very rewarding and the discovery of the Hurricane zone, less than two years after our first exploration program, has been a highlight of my career to date. I am excited for the opportunity to lead our talented team of geologists in exploring our portfolio of highly prospective eastern Athabasca Basin uranium projects. Also, having exclusive access to such a highly regarded and experienced geologist such as Dave Thomas represents an incredible opportunity for the Company.” \r\n\r\n David Thomas \r\n\r\n David Thomas, M.Sc. is a Professional Geoscientist with more than 40 years of experience as a practicing geologist.
