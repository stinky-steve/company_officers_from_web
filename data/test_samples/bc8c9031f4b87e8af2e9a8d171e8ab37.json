(TSXV: CUR) (OTCQB: CURUF) was created in early 2020 to capitalize on an anticipated uranium market resurgence using the proven model of diversified project consolidation. To date, the Company has acquired or has the right to acquire uranium projects in Australia, Canada, Argentina, and the United States each with significant past expenditures and attractive characteristics for development. Most recently, the Company completed a transformational strategic acquisition and alliance with Energy Fuels Inc (NYSE American: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), a leading U.S.-based uranium mining company, and acquired a portfolio of permitted, past-producing conventional uranium and vanadium mines in Utah and Colorado. These mines are currently on stand-by, ready for rapid restart as market conditions permit, positioning CUR as a near-term uranium producer. \r\n \r\n For More Information, Please Contact \r\n \r\n Philip Williams \r\nChairman and CEO \r\n pwilliams@consolidateduranium.com \r\n \r\n Mars Investor Relations \r\n+1 647 557 6640 \r\n cur@marsinvestorrelations.com \r\n \r\nTwitter:  @ConsolidatedUr \r\n www.consolidateduranium.com \r\n \r\nNeither the TSXV nor its Regulations Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. \r\n \r\n Cautionary Statement Regarding “Forward-Looking” Information \r\n \r\n This news release contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. “Forward-looking information” includes, but is not limited to, statements with respect to the completion of the Arrangement; anticipated timing for completion of the Arrangement and Listing; the number of LUR Shares expected to be distributed to each CUR shareholder; anticipated timing for mailing of the DRS statements representing the LUR Shares; and other activities, events or developments that the Company expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future.
