                                         The site was most intensively mined between 1931 and 1947 when approximately 500,000 tonnes of ore were processed. The cut-and-fill method used at the mine yielded an average of 2,270 tonnes of ore per vertical meter over 200 meters of elevation. A 2006 historical resource estimate for molybdenum, copper, and uranium produced the values cited below: 
   
 
 
 
   
 * The estimates presented above are treated as historical information and have not been verified or relied upon for economic evaluation by the Issuer. These historical mineral resources do not refer to any category of the NI-43-101 Instrument. The explanation lies in the inability by the author to verify the data. The Issuer has not done sufficient work yet to classify the historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Therefore, the Issuer is in the opinion that the above quoted resources for the Azegour deposit cannot be relied upon.

Molybdenite (Mo), chalcopyrite (Cu) and  scheelite (W) mineralization is located within the metamorphic aureole of the monzogranite and impregnated in calc-silicate rocks (Figure 2). 
 The metamorphic rocks of the Azegour granite intrusion have created numerous gold, molybdenum, tungsten, and copper mineral deposits of interest within its contact aureole, more specifically in its calcareous layers. To date, the most interesting deposits have been discovered in the central and western layers. The old Azegour Mine, which is believed be a typical copper-molybdenum skarn deposit, was developed in the central layer at the most southern location (see Figure 2).

                                         Molybdenite, scheelite, chalcopyrite and accessory mineralization containing uranium, nickel and cobalt are all located within the metamorphic aureole surrounding the Azegour intrusion. The Mo-W-Cu mineralization is impregnated in calc-silicate rocks formed by grenatites and pyroxenites and presents itself as irregular pods extending in a N-S direction. 
 Molybdenite is associated with grossular-bearing hornfels (Figure 3); scheelite is present in phaneritic andradite-bearing grenatite (Figure 4); and chalcopyrite is found in pyroxene hornfelses (Figure 5).

                                         The Azegour historical mine is located at an altitude of 1,525 meters on the northern side of the Western High Atlas mountains, 80 kilometers SSW of Marrakech, Morocco. The mine, which was operated periodically between 1931 and 1947, was a significant producer of base metals.

                                         The site was most intensively mined between 1931 and 1947 when approximately 500,000 tonnes of ore were processed. The cut-and-fill method used at the mine yielded an average of 2,270 tonnes of ore per vertical meter over 200 meters of elevation. A 2006 historical resource estimate for molybdenum, copper, and uranium produced the values cited below: 
   
 
 
 
   
 * The estimates presented above are treated as historical information and have not been verified or relied upon for economic evaluation by the Issuer. These historical mineral resources do not refer to any category of the NI-43-101 Instrument. The explanation lies in the inability by the author to verify the data. The Issuer has not done sufficient work yet to classify the historical estimates as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Therefore, the Issuer is in the opinion that the above quoted resources for the Azegour deposit cannot be relied upon. 
                                     
                                                             
                                                                             
                                     
     
 
     
         
                             
                     Location 
 The Azegour mine is located in the Occidental range of the High Atlas mountains, 80 kilometers south-southwest of Marrakech. The project lies 12 kilometers south of our Amizmiz property. 
                 
                             
                     Access 
 From Marrakech, a paved highway runs across the Haouz Plain to the town of Amizmiz from where a narrow paved road branches westward for eight kilometers to an intersection near the village of Azegour.

Molybdenite (Mo), chalcopyrite (Cu) and  scheelite (W) mineralization is located within the metamorphic aureole of the monzogranite and impregnated in calc-silicate rocks (Figure 2). 
 The metamorphic rocks of the Azegour granite intrusion have created numerous gold, molybdenum, tungsten, and copper mineral deposits of interest within its contact aureole, more specifically in its calcareous layers. To date, the most interesting deposits have been discovered in the central and western layers. The old Azegour Mine, which is believed be a typical copper-molybdenum skarn deposit, was developed in the central layer at the most southern location (see Figure 2).

                                         Molybdenite, scheelite, chalcopyrite and accessory mineralization containing uranium, nickel and cobalt are all located within the metamorphic aureole surrounding the Azegour intrusion. The Mo-W-Cu mineralization is impregnated in calc-silicate rocks formed by grenatites and pyroxenites and presents itself as irregular pods extending in a N-S direction. 
 Molybdenite is associated with grossular-bearing hornfels (Figure 3); scheelite is present in phaneritic andradite-bearing grenatite (Figure 4); and chalcopyrite is found in pyroxene hornfelses (Figure 5).
