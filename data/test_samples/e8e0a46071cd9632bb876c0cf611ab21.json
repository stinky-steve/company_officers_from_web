ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL COMMISSIONING OF \nBRINE PRODUCTION PHASE OF OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM \n Not for distribution to U.S. news wire services or dissemination in the United States. \nSASKATOON, SK (CNW– SEPTEMBER 6, 2016) – Karnalyte Resources Inc. (“Karnalyte” or the “Company”) (TSX: KRN) is pleased to announce the successful commissioning of the second phase of the optimization program (the “Brine Production Phase”) at the Company’s potash solution mine at Wynyard, Saskatchewan. “I am pleased to report that during the last week of August we successfully commissioned the Brine Production Phase of our optimization program and have now begun to operate the test cavern at design conditions,” said Karnalyte’s President, Robin Phinney. \n The major objective of the optimization program is to test and achieve a higher potash concentration than 9.3% as set out in Karnalyte’s feasibility study which was based on laboratory dissolution tests and computer modelling. Karnalyte anticipates that any increase in potash concentration could significantly reduce projected operating costs and enhance project economics for its planned 625,000 tpy potash production facility. \n The Brine Production Phase consists of a hot leaching process to produce a concentrated potash brine solution. This is accomplished by injecting heated source water from the 500 metre deep Blairmore formation into the production cavern in the 950 metre deep Belle Plaine formation. The concentrated potash brine solution is then brought to surface and analyzed for potash concentration levels in lab facilities at the Saskatchewan Research Council. All brine generated from the optimization program is disposed of in the Company’s 1,500 metre deep disposal well. \n “The optimization program is a critical step in the development of the Company’s Wynyard potash project,” said Phinney. “We believe it has the potential to make the already compelling economics of our project even stronger.” \n Karnalyte anticipates that the Brine Production Phase will run for approximately two months until the end of October, 2016 with a final report on the optimization program expected to be issued by December, 2016. The optimization program was designed by, and the results will be verified and reported on by, Ercosplan Ingenieurgesellschaft Geotechnik und Bergbau mBH of Erfurt, Germany. \n ABOUT KARNALYTE RESOURCES INC. \n Karnalyte is engaged in the business of exploration and development of high-quality potash and \nmagnesium products. Karnalyte intends to develop and extract a carnallite-sylvite mineral deposit through a known solution mining process at competitive costs and with minimal environmental impact. Using a staged approached to construction, the Company plans to operate a solution mining facility that will initially produce 625,000 tpy, increasing to 2.125 million tpy of potash.
