This results in a spherical shape and Size Guide Number that is equivalent to granular Nitrogen and Phosphate fertilizers.  A 99% KCl feedstock from the Karnalyte Process will be utilized, resulting in a low sodium pellet. \n Some advantages include: \n \n Higher purity with low sodium \n Spherical shape \n Uniform size \n Less dust generated during handling \n Lower caking tendency \n Less settling and segregation from a blend \n Resists plugging agricultural equipment \n Less abrasive on agricultural equipment \n \n KCl99 \n Karnalyte has the option to upgrade the 99% KCl feedstock to Industrial Grade potash.  KCl 99 could become an additional product in future phases. \n Karnalyte Potash Products \n Â  \n  \n\n \n\n           \n      \n     \n\n    \n\n   \n\n\n\n  \n\n   \n\n\n  \n     \n\n  \n\n    \n       \n\n    \n     \n       \n         \n\n           \n         \n       \n     \n\n     \n       Toggle the Widgetbar      \n\n    \n  ", "markdown_content": ""}
