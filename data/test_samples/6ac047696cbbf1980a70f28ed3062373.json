This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities. \r\n\r\n Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information \r\n\r\n This press release contains “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “plans”, “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”, or “believes”, or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will be taken”, “occur” or “be achieved”. These forward-looking statements or information may relate to the Arrangement, including statements with respect to the consummation of the Arrangement and the timing thereof; satisfaction of conditions to closing of the Arrangement, including receipt of final court and stock exchange approvals;  and any other activities, events or developments that the companies expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future. \r\n\r\n Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions that, while considered reasonable by management at the time, are inherently subject to business, market and economic risks, uncertainties and contingencies that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to, assumptions that IsoEnergy and Anfield will complete the Arrangement in accordance with, and on the timeline contemplated by the terms and conditions of the relevant agreements; that the parties will receive the required court and stock exchange approvals and will satisfy, in a timely manner, the other conditions to the closing of the Arrangement;  and that general business and economic conditions will not change in a material adverse manner . Although IsoEnergy has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.  \r\n\r\n Such statements represent the current views of IsoEnergy with respect to future events and are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by IsoEnergy, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social risks, contingencies and uncertainties. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following: the inability of IsoEnergy and Anfield to complete the Arrangement; a material adverse change in the timing of and the terms and conditions upon which the Arrangemen tis completed; the inability to satisfy or waive all conditions to closing the Arrangement; the failure to obtain shareholder, regulatory, court or stock exchange approvals in connection with the Arrangement; unanticipated changes in market price for IsoEnergy Shares and/or Anfield shares; changes to IsoEnergy’s and/or Anfield’s current and future business plans and the strategic alternatives available thereto; growth prospects and outlook of Anfield’s business; regulatory determinations and delays; stock market conditions generally; demand, supply and pricing for uranium; and general economic and political conditions in Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions where the applicable party conducts business. Other factors which could materially affect such forward-looking information are described in the risk factors in IsoEnergy’s most recent annual information form, the Circular and IsoEnergy’s other filings with the Canadian securities regulators which are available, respectively, on each company’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. IsoEnergy does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws. \r\n \n  \n\n       \n\n\n       \n\n             \n       \n         \n           News & Media \n           \n         \n         \n           Downloads \n           Corporate Presentation \n           \n         \n       \n\n           \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Keep up-to-date with our latest news \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t", "markdown_content": ""}
