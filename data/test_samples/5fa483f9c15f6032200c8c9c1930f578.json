(“CUR”, the “Company” or “Consolidated Uranium”) (TSXV: CUR) (OTCQX: CURUF) is pleased to announce that further to its press release on May 24, 2023 regarding the creation and planned spin-out (the “Spin-Out”) of Premier American Uranium Inc. (“PUR”), CUR has entered into an agreement with Red Cloud Securities Inc. to act as lead agent and sole bookrunner on behalf of a syndicate of investment dealers (collectively, the “Agents”) in connection with a fully marketed private placement (the “PUR Offering”) of a minimum of 5,750,000 subscription receipts of PUR (each, a “Subscription Receipt”) at a price of C$1.80 per Subscription Receipt (the “Offering Price”) for minimum gross proceeds of C$10,350,000. The Agents will have an option, exercisable in full or in part up to 48 hours prior to the closing of the PUR Offering, to sell up to an additional 833,334 Subscription Receipts at the Offering Price for additional gross proceeds of up to C$1,500,001. The PUR Offering is expected to include lead orders of at least C$2.0 million from each of Mega Uranium Ltd. and funds for which Sachem Cove Partners is the general partner. \r\n\r\n Philip Williams, Chairman and CEO of Consolidated Uranium commented, “We are thrilled to announce this financing for PUR corner stoned by Sachem Cove and Mega Uranium, two of the most knowledgeable and credible investors in the uranium space today. They clearly see the potential in PUR that we see; an exciting portfolio of exploration and development projects in two key U.S. uranium mining jurisdictions, being the Great Divide Basin of Wyoming and the Uravan Mineral Belt of Colorado and a well-timed opportunity to participate in the resurgence of the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle. The funds raised are expected to be used to advance the current portfolio including plans for a drill program at the Cyclone Project and potential project acquisitions as PUR looks to expands its existing footprint and leverage its experienced technical team.” \r\n\r\n Each Subscription Receipt will entitle the holder thereof to automatically receive, upon satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of certain escrow release conditions (the “Escrow Release Conditions”), one unit of PUR. Each Unit shall be comprised of one common share of PUR (each, a “Unit Share”) and one-half of one common share purchase warrant of PUR (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”). Each whole Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one common share of PUR (each, a “Warrant Share”) at a price of C$2.50 for a period of 36 months following the date of issuance of the Warrants. The Escrow Release Conditions includes the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the completion of the Spin-Out as well as receipt of conditional approval for the listing of PUR’s common shares (the “Listing”) on the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSXV”). \r\n\r\n The proceeds of the PUR Offering, net of the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents, will be held in escrow and not released to PUR unless the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied by the deadline provided in the terms of the subscription receipt agreement that will govern the Subscription Receipts (the “Escrow Release Deadline”). If the Escrow Release Conditions have not been satisfied on or prior to the Escrow Release Deadline, the aggregate issue price of the Subscription Receipts (plus any interest earned thereon) will be returned to the holders (net of any applicable withholding taxes), and such Subscription Receipts will be automatically cancelled and be of no further force and effect. \r\n\r\n Following the satisfaction or waiver, as applicable, of the Escrow Release Conditions, the net proceeds of the PUR Offering are expected to be used to fund the proposed exploration programs for PUR’s projects located in the Great Divide Basin of Wyoming and the Uravan Mineral Belt of Colorado as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.  \r\n\r\n This news release does not constitute an offer of securities for sale in the United States. The securities being offered have not been, nor will they be, registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and such securities may not be offered or sold within the United States absent U.S. registration or an applicable exemption from U.S. registration requirements. \r\n\r\n About Premier American Uranium Inc.  \r\n\r\n Premier American Uranium Inc., a subsidiary of Consolidated Uranium Inc. (TSXV: CUR), is focused on the consolidation, exploration, and development of uranium projects in the United States.

Listing will be subject to PUR fulfilling all the requirements of the TSXV. \r\n\r\n For more information, please visit www.premierur.com. \r\n\r\n About Consolidated Uranium Inc. \r\n\r\n Consolidated Uranium Inc.
