Releases Updated Technical Report For Potash And Magnesium Mine At Wynyard, Saskatchewan  \n  “Helping Farmers Succeed”       \n  Not for distribution to U.S. news wire services or dissemination in the United States.    \n  SASKATOON, SK (CNW–July 14, 2016) – Karnalyte Resources Inc. (“Karnalyte” or the “Company”) (TSX: KRN) today released an updated NI 43-101 compliant technical report (the “Technical Report”) for the Company’s planned potash and magnesium mine at Wynyard, Saskatchewan (the “Project”). The Technical Report was prepared for Karnalyte by industry leading solution mining and engineering firms, ERCOSPLAN Ingenieurgesellschaft Geotechnik und Bergbau mbH (“ERCOSPLAN”), Amec Foster Wheeler Canada Ltd.(“AFW”), and North Rim Exploration Ltd. (“North Rim”). The Technical Report independently confirms the size and unique composition of Karnalyte’s deposit which support the Project’s economic viability.   \n  Since 2007, Karnalyte has worked diligently to independently confirm the size and grade of Karnalyte’s potash deposit and complete the required engineering for development of the Project. As a result, Karnalyte attracted India’s Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited (“GSFC”) as a strategic partner and secured an offtake agreement for sales of approximately 56% of the Company’s potash production from the first phase of Karnalyte’s 625,000 tonnes per year (tpy) potash mine at Wynyard, Saskatchewan (“Phase 1”).   \n  With the release of the Technical Report, the Company will now focus on securing sales for the remainder of the production from Phase 1. Karnalyte has commissioned extensive market research and retained toptier expertise to develop a value optimizing sales strategy which is driven by Karnalyte’s unique potash  deposit. The Company has considered how to best align itself with the two primary drivers of demand in  the potash market: 1. Price, and 2. Grade.    \n  “We have developed a strategy to leverage the Company’s unique high-grade, low-sodium products to successfully compete in the North American potash marketplace by placing more emphasis on grade,” said Mr. Phinney, Karnalyte’s President. “We are confident that the end users of fertilizer, the farmers, will choose the highest grade product with the lowest sodium content.”   \n  The Company is targeting market demand for high-purity potash by producing a superior grade (99%  purity) compacted agricultural granular product, KCl 99 TM , at a competitive price compared to typical compacted granular potash which averages 95.5% purity and 4 – 4.5% sodium. “We believe providing agricultural producers with a superior grade product – at or near the same price point as the industry’s granular products – will ensure the Company can secure sales for the remaining 44% of production from Phase 1,” said Mr. Phinney.    \n  High Grade Potash    \n  The unique composition of the Wynyard carnallitite deposit allows the Company to produce high-purity potash products with low sodium content. In addition to serving the 97% purity granular agricultural  potash market through GSFC in India, Karnalyte has identified an opportunity for a new market entrant that can produce high-grade potash products at a competitive cost in North America. These are the:            \n  • 99% purity compacted agricultural granular potash market; and the \n • 99% purity industrial grade KCl market.   \n  The Company intends to produce KCl 97 TM  “Helping Farmers Succeed”   to serve the 97% purity granular agricultural market through GSFC in India, and KCl 99 TM  to serve the North American high-grade markets. Karnalyte plans to employ a known solution mining method and has secured several patents for the extraction and formulation of these high-grade products. The Company has been in contact with potential buyers who have expressed interest and confirmed these new products are well suited to their requirements.    \n  In addition, the Company is exploring multiple options for the sale of its potash products including entering into a strategic partnership with an existing potash producer in Saskatchewan. This includes the sale and distribution of Karnalyte’s proprietary KCl 99 TM  granular product to the North American market and the application of Karnalyte’s 99% purity crystals as a ‘grade sweetener’ to other producers’ lower grade (95.5% purity) potash products. Mr. Phinney stated:   \n  “The unique purity of Karnalyte’s product line could provide an existing Saskatchewan potash producer with a competitive edge in sales by blending its current production with Karnalyte’s high-purity crystals. By upgrading their existing production, a high-grade blended product could become the fertilizer of choice for farmers,” said Mr. Phinney. “This value added strategy could provide an existing potash producer in Saskatchewan with a significant advantage by providing their customers with a superior, higher-grade fertilizer product in an otherwise undifferentiated, price driven global market.”   \n  The Company believes that by focusing its available production on a mix of high-grade products it will not need to compete on the basis of price alone, but can leverage grade to secure sales. \n   Technical Report Highlights    \n  The Technical Report contains a comprehensive overview of Karnalyte’s property, geology, mining and recovery methods, required infrastructure, mineral resource and mineral reserves estimates, and all other aspects of the Project, with an effective date of June 23, 2016. The Technical Report includes separate analyses of both the potash and magnesium development opportunities (all figures in Canadian $):    \n Potash Project  \n – for the production of  97% purity KCl granular potash prills \n • NPV (8% discount)   $3.39 billion for 3 Phases, 2.125 million tpy project \n• CAPEX for Phase 1    $789 million \n• Cost per installed tonne of Capacity  $1,262 for Phase 1 \n• OPEX for Phase 1   $136.99 per tonne \n• IRR (after tax)    19.1% for 3 Phases, 2.125 million tpy project \n• Estimated Mine Life   over 70 years for 3 Phases, 2.125 million tpy project \n• Proven Reserves for KCl of: \no Carnallitite    269 million tonnes at 18.7% KCl, equivalent to 47  million tonnes of product \no Sylvinite   53 million tonnes at 26.2% KCl, equivalent to 13 million  tonnes of product  \n • Probable Reserves for KCl of: \n o Carnallitite    425 million tonnes at 18.6% KCl, equivalent to 73  million tonnes of product \no Sylvinite   62 million tonnes at 25.6% KCl, equivalent to 15 million  tonnes of product  \n The discounted cash flow model to determine Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) \nfor the 2,125 million tpy Potash Project assume a commencement date for production in 2019 and a \npotash price of $466 (Canadian) per tonne based on a consensus price of potash market analysts with a \n3% annual price increase.  \n Magnesium Project – for the production of 100,000 tpy of MgCl  brine and 104,000 tpy of Hydromagnesite \n • NPV (10% discount)   $512 million \n• CAPEX (additional to Phase 1)  $171 million \n• OPEX for MgCl  Brine    $7.01 per tonne \n• OPEX for Hydromagnesite   $302.01 per tonne \n• IRR (after tax)    26.1% \n• Probable Reserves for MgCl 695 million tonnes of carnallitite at 22.1% MgCl, equivalent to 8 million tonnes of product  \n The discounted cash flow model to determine Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for the Magnesium Project was determined based on prices of: $40 per tonne for MgCl  brine, $600 per  tonne for 50% of the Hydromagnesite as replacement for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate, and the remaining Hydromagnesite at $1800 per tonne as replacement for TiO2  in paint pigments. \nIn assessing the value of the project the following key figures were determined using a discounted cash flow model:  \n • net present value (NPV): The NPV compares the present value of all cash inflows with the present value of all cash outflows. A positive NPV indicates that a project is expected to give a return in excess of the cost of capital; and \n• internal rate of return (IRR): The IRR is the cost of capital or required rate of return which when used to discount the cash flows of a project produces a zero NPV.  \n The discounted cash flow model, including the metrics and methodology thereof (the “Model”) may not be directly comparable to Models used by other issuers. For further detail please refer to the Technical Report entitled KCl and MgCl  Reserve and Resource Estimate for the Wynyard Carnallite Project, Subsurface Mineral Leases KL 246, KL 247 and KLSA 010, Saskatchewan, Canada with an effective date June 23, 2016 filed on the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com.   \n Key Milestones to Date  \n Karnalyte has achieved an impressive list of milestones by following a disciplined and pragmatic \napproach to its business plan. To date, the Company has:  \n • Acquired a 100% interest in subsurface mineral leases KLSA 010, KL 246 and KL 247, comprising a total of 91,152 acres (36,965 hectares, or 368.89km \n• Conducted 3D seismic and drilling programs to confirm resource continuity; \n• Received a positive Feasibility Study (2011) for the planned 2.125 million tpy potash production facility (updated in 2016); \n• Received a positive Pre-Feasibility study (2012) for the production of magnesium compounds (updated in 2016); \n• Secured extraction process and production patents which enhance efficiency for the processing of both potash and magnesium compounds; \n• Entered into a strategic 20 year off-take agreement with GSFC for the purchase of approximately 350,000 tpy of potash from Phase 1 of the Project, increasing to 600,000 tpy with the commencement of Phase 2, with a potential total of 1,000,000 tpy with the commencement of Phase 3 (the “Offtake”). The Offtake with GSFC minimizes the risks of the Project by securing sales for approximately 56% of production from Phase 1 and provides Karnalyte with access to an established fertilizer distribution network in India; \n• Received approval for the Environmental Impact Statement from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment; \n• Drilled and successfully tested two commercial production capacity source water wells for nonpotable, non-agricultural use source \nwater; \n• Received water rights licence from the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency; \n• Drilled and successfully tested a disposal well at commercial production volumes; \n• Received disposal well permit from the Ministry of Economy; \n• Received the development permit clear of all conditions from the Saskatchewan Ministry of Economy; \n• Prepared the Wynyard plant site for construction of Phase 1; and \n• The Company is currently in the process of conducting an optimization test program which is designed to increase concentration of potash in the brine solution and reduce the number of required caverns, which the Company expects will further improve projected economics.    \n Having met these milestones Karnalyte’s Wynyard Potash Project is now at the construction-ready stage. The Company has been able to achieve these milestones while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Karnalyte has no debt, approximately $22 million in the treasury and has incurred minimal dilution to equity with only 27,561,010 common shares outstanding.   \n The Company believes that by securing sales for the remainder of the production from Phase 1 it  will  further de-risk the financing for Phase 1 and position itself to ensure the long term sustainability of the Project. “As a result of Karnalyte’s unique high-grade, low-sodium resource, the Company is now well positioned to become a leading producer of superior grade potash,” said Mr. Phinney “We believe that farmers will choose Karnalyte’s KCl 99  over other competitors’ products, and when farmers succeed, \nKarnalyte succeeds.” \n  Technical Report and Qualified Persons  \n The principal author of the Technical Report is Dr. Henry Rauche EurGeol, of ERCOSPLAN.
