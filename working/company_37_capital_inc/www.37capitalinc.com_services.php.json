These serve to show precisely what a project will look like based on a final design incorporating the selected materials and precisely presented landscaping. Our rendering techniques vary to best fit your project, the stage of your development, your timeline and budget. \r\n                             \n                         \n                        \n                    \n                     \n                           \n                  \n                          \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                            \n                                \n                                 \n                                   Virtual Reality (VR) & Augmented Reality (AR)                                 \n                             \n                         \n                             Virtual reality or virtual realities (VR), which can be referred to as immersive multimedia or  computer-simulated  reality, replicates an environment and simulates a physical presence in places in the real world or an imagined world, allowing the user to interact in that world. Virtual realities artificially create sensory experiences, which can include sight, hearing, touch, and smell. \r\n\r\n Most up-to-date virtual realities are displayed either on a computer screen or with special  stereoscopic displays , and some simulations include additional sensory information and focus on real sounds through speakers or headphones targeted towards VR users.  \r\n                             \n                         \n                        \n                    \n                     \n                           \n                  \n                          \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                            \n                                \n                                 \n                                   Interactive Videos & Product Models                                 \n                             \n                         \n                             These videos give the viewer an opportunity to change the angle of view. On the web you can do this by dragging around the video with your cursor, and on mobile devices you can do it by dragging with your finger. \r\n\r\n Alternatively, you can hold up your phone and the 360 degree video will follow you as you turn. The enables true interactivity and allows a viewer to appreciate the space in totality and at his own pace. \r\n                             \n                         \n                        \n                    \n                     \n                           \n                  \n                          \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                           \n                            \n                                \n                                 \n                                   Corporate Presentations                                 \n                             \n                         \n                             We partner with you and help pique the interest of customers in your firm & its projects by communicating and packaging your Credentials and the project USP’s in a compelling and captivating manner. \r\n\r\n\r\n                             \n                         \n                        \n                    \n                                     \n                 \n              \n                   \n                 \n             \n    \n                   \n    \t", "markdown_content": ""}
